# Yzma's Campaign Journal — Hell's Rebels

## A. Campaign Arc: Yzma's Journey

### Origins (Pre-Campaign)
Born into House Tennessan, a minor noble family of Kintargo. Father Geoff Tennessan is a powerful mage who, unlike Yzma's older brothers and cousin Rufus, is not a blind Thrune fanatic. Yzma's natural magical affinity (rather than studied wizardry) caused her siblings to bully and outcast her. This family rift shaped her early life and later drove her toward the Silver Ravens rebellion.

### The Rebellion (Levels ~12-14)
Joined the Silver Ravens, operating from an underground hideout in O7 district beneath a burned tavern. Early sessions involved:
- Battling cousin Rufus at a celebration (captured him, took his Cloak of Resistance)
- Traveling to Hell to meet contract devil Adoxidie, learning the Kintargo Contract's hidden clause: if no lord mayor exists, House Thrune can enter at will
- Liberating slaves, navigating noble politics, and securing allies for the rebellion

### Political Intrigue (Levels 14-15)
Worked to install Roxis Victicora as Lord Mayor:
- Reconciled (partially) with father Geoff Tennessan, who passed a note expressing regret for the family wedge
- Secured votes from the Board of Governors through diplomacy, trade, and occasional magical persuasion
- Successfully elected Roxis as Lord Mayor of Kintargo through both noble vote and public election

### Chiliax Negotiations (Level 15-16)
Led Silver Ravens delegation negotiating Kintargo's independence from Chiliax:
- Navigated Athena's secret offer from Absalom Court (rejected)
- Survived assassination attempt that killed lead negotiator (blamed on Nordeburger assassin)
- Successfully signed treaty securing Kintargo's transition out of Chiliax while maintaining favorable trade and military terms
- Made enemy of "The Dark Star"

### The Hunt for Thrune's Heart (Level 16-17)
Discovered Barzillai Thrune removed his own heart and placed it in a soul anchor to prevent true death. If not stopped, he will become a "Genesis Loki" — a genocidal entity. Current quest:
- Investigated phantom pains and supernatural disturbances across Kintargo linked to Thrune
- Used Commune spell to locate soul anchor: underground, south of Nisroch, on the continent of Glarion
- Defeated Popobala creature causing gloom over the city
- Followed supernatural pull to Crypt of Esberdeen, descended 2,000 feet into the Mouth of Souls
- Currently exploring caverns seeking the soul-bound phylactery containing Thrune's heart

## B. Current State: Where We Left Off

**Level:** 17 (Sorcerer)

**Location:** Lucky Bones hideout in Kintargo, fully rested after a day of recovery

**Immediate Situation:** The party has been exploring deep underground caverns accessed through the Crypt of Esberdeen (the Mouth of Souls). We discovered a massive dragon hoard from a dead elder red dragon, fought shadow demon panthers and shadow golems bearing the Ilvarandi family crest from Nidel, and retreated to Kintargo to heal Liana's blindness at the Temple of Shelae.

**The Pull:** Yzma continues to feel an innate supernatural pull toward the soul-bound phylactery containing Thrune's heart. This sensation is familiar — similar to when she was pulled into the jar during the Professor Mengeoff vision. The heart is deeper in the caverns, still waiting to be found.

**Party Status:**
- All members rested with full spells/resources
- Max (Cleric) absent due to family obligations — may bring Hero (fighter NPC) as substitute
- Ready to return to the caverns

## C. Things to Remember Going Into Next Session

### Tactical Considerations
- **Shadow Golems:** If more appear, remember they're immune to cold, have infinite SR, and resist physical attacks except adamantine slashing. Light spells (like Gem of Brightness) suppress their shadow aura and slow them. Searing Light slows them with no save.
- **Gem of Brightness:** 8 charges remaining — valuable for golem encounters
- **White Robe of the Archmagi:** Yzma now has +5 AC, SR 18, +4 to saves, and +2 to caster level checks vs SR
- **Ring of Telekinesis:** New acquisition — useful for manipulation at range
- **Orb of Utter Chaos:** Stored in Bag of Holding. Dangerous to lawful characters.

### Story Threads to Track
- **Ilvarandi Family:** The shadow golems came from this pro-Thrune family in Nidel. Someone important (likely Thrune himself) persuaded them to loan such valuable constructs. Political implications possible.
- **The Dead Dragon:** An elder red dragon killed by lightning — something powerful enough to kill a red dragon with lightning lives (or lived) in these caverns
- **The Rage Chamber:** Humanoid bodies were torn apart and scattered here. The dragon was already dead, so something else did this.
- **The Dark Star:** Made enemies during negotiations — may resurface

### Personal Notes
- Yzma has approximately 115,000 gp in wealth
- The Temple of Shelae priests noted the party only visits for paid services, never charitable donations (possible reputation issue?)
- Kronk (fairy dragon familiar) continues to be useful for scouting dangerous areas

## D. Most Recent Session: 2025-12-21 (Yzma's Perspective)

We descended deeper into the caverns, following the pull I've felt since the Crypt of Esberdeen. The sensation is uncomfortably familiar — that same tugging at my being that I experienced when Professor Mengeoff's vision pulled me into the jar.

We found the bones of an elder red dragon. I collected one of its horns for dragon bone dust — good trade value. The strange thing: the dragon died from lightning. Red dragons. Killed by electricity. Something powerful did this.

Sending Kronk ahead to scout an unreachable plateau, he discovered a dragon hoard. I used companion transposition to reach it and found treasure beyond counting — over 70,000 gold in coins alone, platinum, gems, and magical items. I claimed the White Robe of the Archmagi (I can feel its protective magic settling around me) and a Ring of Telekinesis. The Orb of Utter Chaos we found is safely stored — too dangerous to carry openly.

Moving deeper, the mushrooms stopped glowing. Darkness gathered. We encountered shadow demon panthers — I turned invisible initially, then used my breath weapon when the moment was right. The fire terrified them. They fled off cliffs rather than face the flames.

Then the shadow golems emerged from the pit, walking on air, their auras swallowing the light around them. They bore the crest of the Ilvarandi family — a pro-Thrune house from Nidel. Someone important convinced them to loan such valuable guardians. We're getting close to something Thrune desperately wants protected.

The fight was brutal. Liana was blinded by necrotic magic that also blocked healing. I used my Gem of Brightness to suppress one golem's shadow aura, slowing it. Luther destroyed them both, but not before they'd wounded all of us.

We retreated to Kintargo. The Temple of Shelae healed Liana through one of their... unconventional rituals. I participated in the chanting. Made my fortitude save. Didn't ask what was in the incense.

Now we rest at the Lucky Bones, fully recovered. Max is away with family. The pull toward Thrune's heart hasn't faded. Tomorrow, we go back down.

The heart is waiting. So is whatever killed that dragon.
