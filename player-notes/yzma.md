## Background

*Child of Kintargo trait*: Born into House Tennesan (minor noble family, related to the noble families of Kintargo). Father is Geoff Tennesan, a powerful mage and practiced swordsman. Unlike older brothers and cousin (Rufus), Geoff is not a blind Thrune fanatic. Yzma's natural magical affinity (sorcery vs. studied wizardry) caused siblings to bully and outcast her.

- Father passed Yzma a note regretting the family wedge, wishing he'd been more involved in her upbringing
- Cousin Rufus attacked the Silver Ravens at Breakbridge with demons, calling them murderers and thieves
- Charlotte (teleportation support ally) is betrothed to Yzma's cousin

## Role

- Journal author / player perspective character
- Advisor to Lord Mayor Roxis Victicora (Silver Ravens-backed candidate)
- Silver Ravens member operating from underground HQ in O7 district

## Familiar

**Kronk** - Faerie Dragon
