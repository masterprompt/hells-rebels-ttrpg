# Session: 2025-10-26

## LEVEL UP: Level 17

## Summary

Dealt with the Popobala creature. Received supernatural pull toward Thrune's heart location.

## Popobala Encounter

- Small bat flew from tree, transformed into large creature
- **Skalkie, the Popobala** - feeds on evil energy in city
- Fought for few rounds before Yzma charmed it
- As Max began sending it to Hell (nicely), Luther (deaf from fumble) saw "hell" in Silver Sign
- Luther began attacking the creature
- Max successfully sent it to 9th circle of Hell (where it can feast on evil/suffering)

## Aftermath

- Gloom/fog began dissipating
- Asmodeus temple bells rang out
- Sound like monstrous heartbeat in the ringing

## The Pull

- Yzma felt pull on her being toward the west
- Innate understanding of where heart is located
- Pull feels familiar - similar to when pulled into the jar (Professor Mengeoff vision)

## Following the Pull

- Walked to graveyard in D6
- Led to a tomb: plain looking crypt, overgrown with ivy, unmaintained
- **Crypt of Esberdeen**

## Crypt Investigation

- Center has illusion + transmutation aura where sarcophagus should be
- Determined: It's an elevator
- Voice: "Welcome to the Mouth of Souls, give your gift to the Dowager of Illusions, and be shown to the bowels below"

### Knowledge Check (Luther)
- **Mahatula** - one of the 4 hag gods of Hell

### Descent
- Luther cut himself, offering blood to activate elevator
- 2,000 feet down (20 feet per 6 seconds = 10 minutes)
- Chamber at bottom with large double doors to east
- Opened left door

## Combat: Ghost Dragon
