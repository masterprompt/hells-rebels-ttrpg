## Usage Notes

- **Pre-combat buff**: Eagle's Splendor (+4 CHA) boosts spell DCs and spells per day. Use before important encounters.
- **Healing**: 122 total healing charges across 4 wands. Prioritize the nearly-depleted CSW wand (3 charges) first.
- **Dispel Magic**: 45 charges is a deep reserve for stripping enemy buffs.
- **Flamestrike**: Useful divine fire damage (half fire, half divine - bypasses fire resistance on the divine half).
- **Utility**: Charm Person, Sleep, and Silent Image are low-level but situationally useful for non-combat encounters.
