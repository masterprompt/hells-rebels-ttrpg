## Summary

Explored caverns seeking the soul-bound phylactery containing Thrune's heart. Discovered an elder dragon's remains and a massive dragon hoard. Fought shadow demon panthers and shadow golems bearing the Ilvarandi family crest from Nidel. Liana was blinded by necrotic magic and healed at the Temple of Shelae. Max absent due to family obligations.

## Current Quest

Seeking the soul-bound phylactery that has Thrune's heart to prevent him from becoming a genocidal Loki.

## Key Events

### Rage Chamber Discovery
- Liana found a chamber where humanoid bodies had been violently torn apart
- Bones smashed against walls, some impaled in rock face
- Bodies were relatively fresh (had decaying flesh when killed)
- The elder dragon was already dead when this happened - something else did this

### Elder Red Dragon Bones
- Yzma felt pulled in directions innately; followed the pull
- Found bones of an elder red dragon
- Dragon died from lightning (unusual for red dragon - what killed it?)
- Found detached femur pressed into cavern wall with scattered remains

### Dragon Hoard Discovery
- Two 20-foot raised plateaus at north and south ends of chamber
- Sent familiars (Liana's owl, Yzma's fairy dragon Kronk) to investigate
- Yzma used companion transposition to teleport to southern plateau

### Combat: Shadow Demon Panthers (4)
- Found area where mushrooms weren't glowing despite being present
- Encountered four shadow demon panthers in dim-light area
- Panthers used cone of cold breath weapons
- Party used fire damage effectively - panthers fled when ignited
- Luther used new Wings of the Gargoyle for aerial attacks
- Liana finished remaining wounded panther with Flaming Sphere
- Luther collected demon panther teeth from fading corpses

### Combat: Shadow Golems (2)
- Two large shadow golems emerged from pit, walking on air
- From **Nidel** (neighboring necromantic nation)
- Bore insignia of **Ilvarandi family** (pro-Thrune)
- Key abilities identified:
  - Infinite spell resistance
  - Resist physical attacks except adamantine slashing
  - Shadow aura dims light within 60 feet, allows air walk
  - Light spells suppress aura and slow them
  - Sunbeam/Sunburst do d8s instead of d6s
  - Searing Light slows them (no save)
- Yzma used Gem of Brightness to suppress shadow aura
- Golem B blinded Liana permanently (failed fortitude save)
- Luther destroyed both golems with fire-enhanced flurry attacks

### Ilvarandi Connection Theory
- Ilvarandi family is pro-Thrune but not closely allied enough to freely give such constructs
- Someone (likely Barzillai Thrune himself) personally persuaded them to loan the golems
- Shadow golems make sense as phylactery guardians - no food/maintenance needed

### Teleport to Temple of Shelae
- Liana's blindness also blocked magical healing
- Made 1,000gp donation for hour-long blindness removal ritual
- Ritual involved: spinning "scolopokide" goggles, priests chanting on beanbags, altered-state substances
- Luther refused to participate (Diamond Body immunity)
- Yzma joined the chanting
- Liana donated additional 300gp for healing
- Luther donated 10gp, received 13 HP

### Rest and Recovery
- Returned to Lucky Bones base
- Rested full day to recover spells and HP
- Luther mentioned interest in eventually purchasing Lucky Bones property
