# Session: 2026-02-15

## Summary

Continued ascending the Tower of Bone in Cana (eighth layer of hell). Passed through four more flaw portals (Contempt, an unnamed flaw with a vision of Thrune's mother, Obsession, and Gynophobia), bringing the total absorbed to six of eight. Fought Handmaid Devils disguised as nuns in the Hall of Penitence and hellish Viper Vines whose poison charmed Yzma and Liana. Reached the sixth floor - Thrune's personal reliquary - where Yzma's exceptional diplomacy (rolls of 35-45) avoided combat with an Apostate Devil librarian named Fenbrin. Learned the second undamned soul is **Therothren**, an azata held on the seventh floor. Session ended with party preparing to ascend to the seventh floor.

## Key Events

### Portal 3: Flaw of [Mother's Abuse]
- Luther voluntarily absorbed this flaw
- Vision: Thrune's mother catching young Barzillai spying on his sister bathing, then beating him with a flail
- Mechanical effect: -2 Will saves

### Portal 4: Flaw of Contempt
- Max voluntarily absorbed this flaw (his second)
- Vision: Young Thrune forcing a servant to clean a chamber pot without tools
- Mechanical effect: -2 AC

### Portal 5: Flaw of Gynophobia/Impotence
- Yzma absorbed this flaw (her second)
- Sickened condition imposed (cannot be removed while in hell)

### Portal 6: Flaw of Obsession
- Luther absorbed this flaw (his second)
- Exact mechanical effect unclear

### Hall of Penitence - Handmaid Devil Fight
- Returned to a chamber with tortured children (damned souls who neglected duties to Thrune through pregnancy or caring for family)
- Two **Handmaid Devils (Hamadriads)** disguised as nuns oversaw the torment
- One devil touched the crystallized heart, turning it purple and pulsing 26 unholy damage to all party members
- Three **Anerys** (black-feathered angel-like devils) were summoned as reinforcements
- Luther discovered Stunning Fist can be used 17 times per day at level 17 (once per round) - far more powerful than previously thought
- Luther one-shot stunned the first Handmaid Devil
- Combat resolved efficiently once party engaged

### Viper Vine Chamber - Poison and Chaos
- Entered chamber with hellish Viper Vines growing from a bed of damned souls used as fertilizer
- Vines released poison spores causing mind-affecting compulsion (victims compelled to approach plants)
- **Yzma charmed**: Repeatedly tried reaching the plants; Luther physically restrained and hog-tied her
- **Liana charmed**: Jumped into Liana's own Acid Pit spell (60 feet deep) alongside the vines
- Key discovery: Viper Vines are **immune to acid** - they floated on the acid pit, making the spell counterproductive
- Max used Dimension Door to rescue Liana, but she jumped back through a portal while still charmed
- One Viper Vine "triple crit-failed" and strangled itself to death
- Luther dealt 149+ damage to finish remaining vines
- Poison/charm effects last one minute; party developed strategy of physical restraint for charmed members

### Reliquary of Barzillai Thrune (Sixth Floor)
- Massive organized library with 200-foot ceilings, orderly bookshelves, and pedestals with cursed artifacts
- Records everything Thrune did in life and his plans for after death
- 20-foot brass statue of Mephisto (three pairs of wings: bat, angel, and a third type)
- Damned souls catalog books as punishment (they were illiterate/uneducated in life)
- Incomplete ancient tome displayed in a glass cage (purpose unknown)
- Two side chambers: one for an incomplete "portal of flame" project, one for punishing poor librarians
- **"The Containment"**: Southern portal leads to chamber where souls are pickled in acid while experiencing nightmares

### Fenbrin - Apostate Devil Librarian
- Met **Fenbrin**, an Apostate Devil (large armored creature with glowing embers) serving as curator
- Yzma's exceptional diplomacy prevented combat entirely (multiple rolls of 35-45)
- Traded a copper piece for information about Thrune's favorite color (tangerine/orange-pink)
- Fenbrin provided key intelligence about tower structure:
  - Currently on sixth floor (European counting)
  - Seventh floor contains second undamned soul: **Therothren** (an azata)
  - Therothren was captured by a "creature of fire and metal" (likely Fenbrin himself - matches description of who captured Narspira)
  - Eighth/ninth floor is tower roof where Thrune is chained
- Nearly caused combat when Yzma accidentally called Fenbrin a "demon" (recovered with 42 Diplomacy)
- Fenbrin provided a formal receipt for the copper piece transaction (documentation is sacred to devils)

## Items Acquired

- **3x +1 Longswords** (~1,000gp resale each)
- **3x +1 Flaming Composite Longbows** (+5 Str) (~4,000gp resale each)
- **3x Ropes** (negligible value)
- **Receipt** from Fenbrin for copper piece transaction

**Estimated total resale**: ~15,000gp

## NPCs

- **Fenbrin** - Apostate Devil, librarian/curator of Thrune's reliquary (sixth floor). Lawful evil, very particular about organization and contracts. Provided valuable intel about tower layout and second undamned soul location. Possibly the same "creature of fire and metal" who captured both undamned souls.
- **Therothren** - Second undamned soul. An azata held captive on the seventh floor. Fenbrin described azata as "despicable" and the "foulest creatures." Not yet encountered.
- **Handmaid Devils (Hamadriads)** - Two devil overseers disguised as nuns, torturing damned children in the Hall of Penitence
- **Anerys** - Black-feathered angel-like devils, three summoned as reinforcements during Handmaid Devil fight

## Locations

- **Tower of Bone, Floors 3-6** - Progressed through multiple portal chambers and combat encounters
- **Hall of Penitence** (revisited) - Chamber with torture implements; children punished for neglecting duties to Thrune
- **Viper Vine Chamber** - Room with hellish plants growing from damned souls used as fertilizer; portals leading multiple directions
- **Reliquary of Barzillai Thrune** (Sixth Floor) - Massive organized library, 200-foot ceilings, brass Mephisto statue, cursed artifact displays, incomplete ancient tome in glass cage

## Combat

| Encounter | Result | Notable |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 2 Handmaid Devils + 3 Anerys | Victory | Crystallized heart pulsed 26 unholy damage to party; Luther's Stunning Fist proved devastating (17/day at level 17); quick resolution |
| 5+ Viper Vines | Victory | Acid Pit backfired (vines immune to acid); poison charmed Yzma and Liana; Luther hog-tied Yzma; one vine killed itself on triple crit-fail; Luther dealt 149+ damage to finish |

## Flaw Tracking (Updated)

| Flaw | Absorbed By | Mechanical Effect | Vision |
|------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Cruelty** | Max | -2 Fortitude saves | Young Thrune vivisecting a weasel (Session 02-08) |
| **Impotence/Shame** | Yzma | Sickened (party-wide) | Thrune fleeing brothel in shame (Session 02-08) |
| **Mother's Abuse** | Luther | -2 Will saves | Thrune's mother beating him with flail after catching him spying on sister |
| **Contempt** | Max | -2 AC | Young Thrune forcing servant to clean chamber pot without tools |
| **Gynophobia** | Yzma | Sickened (cannot be removed in hell) | Details unclear |
| **Obsession** | Luther | Unknown | Details unclear |

**Current burden**: Max (2 flaws), Yzma (2 flaws), Luther (2 flaws), Liana (0 flaws)
**Remaining**: 2 more flaws to absorb before confronting Thrune

## Outstanding Tasks

**PRIMARY**: Ascend to seventh floor to locate and rescue Therothren (second undamned soul - azata)

**ACTIVE**:
- Absorb remaining two flaws to fully weaken Thrune
- Reach tower roof (eighth/ninth floor) to confront Thrune's transformed soul
- Return Thrune's heart to his soul-bound body to prevent Genocide Loki ascension
- Distribute remaining two flaws strategically (Liana has taken none so far)

**OPTIONAL/UNEXPLORED**:
- Explore "The Containment" (southern portal - pickle jar/acid nightmare chamber)
- Investigate the incomplete "portal of flame" project
- Examine the ancient tome in the glass cage
- Investigate cursed artifacts on display in reliquary

## Strategic Notes

- **Yzma's diplomacy** is a campaign-defining asset - avoided a potentially deadly fight with an Apostate Devil through social skills alone
- **Luther's Stunning Fist** is far more powerful than previously understood (17 uses/day, once per round at level 17)
- **Luther's Throat Crush** ability prevents verbal spellcasting - useful for controlling charmed party casters
- **Poison/charm duration**: Effects last one minute; physical restraint is viable counter-strategy
- **Acid is unreliable in hell**: Viper Vines immune to acid; Acid Pit spell was counterproductive
- Party has resist fire 30 (fire damage from portals negated), but unholy damage continues to be a threat
- Max's teleportation (Dimension Door) provides critical tactical mobility and rescue capability
- **Devil etiquette matters**: Never call a devil a "demon" - nearly caused a diplomatic incident with Fenbrin
- Fenbrin may be the same entity who captured both undamned souls (described as "creature of fire and metal" in both cases)

## Campaign Progress (Sessions 2025-12-21 through 2026-02-15)

1. **2025-12-21**: Explored Darklands caverns, defeated shadow demon panthers and shadow golems, discovered dragon hoard
2. **2026-01-11**: Found soul anchor with Thrune's heart, learned must travel to Hell to retrieve his soul first
3. **2026-02-08**: Plane-shifted to Cana (8th layer of hell), entered Tower of Bone, absorbed first two flaws, rescued Narspira (first undamned soul - nereid)
4. **2026-02-15**: Progressed through floors 3-6, absorbed four more flaws (6/8 total), identified Therothren as second undamned soul on seventh floor

## Unresolved Mysteries

- What is the incomplete ancient tome in the glass cage in the reliquary?
- What are the specific cursed properties of the displayed artifacts?
- Will the incomplete "portal of flame" be relevant before we reach Thrune?
- What is Therothren's story - why was this azata captured and held here?
- What exact mechanical effect does Luther's "Obsession" flaw impose?
- Why does the Mephisto statue have three different pairs of wings?
- What horrors await in "The Containment" pickle chamber?
- What are the final two flaws, and how will they affect the party?
