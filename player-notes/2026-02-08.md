# Session: 2026-02-08

## Summary

Party plane-shifted to the eighth layer of hell (Cana) to confront Barzillai Thrune's transformed soul and return his heart. Entered the Tower of Bone, a structure built from the torments of those who failed Thrune in life. Passed through two portals representing Thrune's flaws (Cruelty and an unnamed flaw causing sickness). Fought Hamatula (barbed devils/war devils) in the Hall of Penitence. Discovered and freed Narspira, a nereid held captive in the bathhouse. Max absent from start but joined partway through session.

## Current Quest

Return Thrune's heart to his soul-bound body in hell to prevent his ascension to godhood (Genocide Loki). Must navigate the Tower of Bone through trials representing Thrune's greatest flaws.

## Key Events

### Arrival in Hell
- Party used gate spell (through handbasket) to plane shift directly to Tower of Bone
- Met **Orgothan**, a pit fiend servant of Mephisto, who greeted them with protocol
- Three rules established:
  1. Don't venture beyond the Tower of Bone
  2. Don't release truly damned souls (those who failed Thrune)
  3. Don't bypass trials - they weaken Thrune
- Party traded three teacup fragments (gift from Captain Sageyta) for information

### Tower Structure Information
- Nine floors total (eighth being roof where Thrune is chained)
- Eight trials corresponding to Thrune's greatest flaws
- Flaws can be absorbed by party members to weaken Thrune
- Taking too many flaws onto one person will cripple that character
- Two undamned souls exist in the tower and may be rescued
- By opposing Thrune so well, party has earned Mephisto's respect

### Portal 1: Flaw of Cruelty
- Max voluntarily absorbed this flaw
- Took 9 fire damage, 9 unholy damage, received -2 on all fortitude saves
- Vision: Young Thrune vivisecting a weasel in front of his crying younger sister
- Tower shook and distant scream of pain heard (presumably Thrune)
- Others took reduced damage (5 fire, 5 unholy for some; 4 fire, 4 unholy for others)

### Hall of Penitence Combat
- Chamber with torture implements, iron maidens, racks, stretching racks
- Five layers of 10-foot alcoves with barred cells containing damned souls
- Fought two **Hamatula** (barbed devils, also called "war devils")
  - Six-legged spider-like devils with military tactics
  - Immune to fire and poison, resist acid and cold
  - High spell resistance, resist non-good physical attacks
  - Vulnerable to electricity
- One **half-orc prisoner** recognized - berserker who nearly killed Walter during Temple of Asmodeus raid
- Max failed will save and turned torture rack once, feeling compelled to increase prisoner's suffering
- Max felt pleasure initially but subsequent attempts were less satisfying
- Liana used Quicken Rod to cast haste as swift action, then shot arrows (119 damage first round)
- Max cast divine power and enlarged himself
- Combat resolved quickly with concentrated attacks
- Max and Luther both finished devils efficiently

### Portal 2: Bathhouse (Flaw of [Impotence/Shame])
- Yzma voluntarily absorbed this flaw
- Took 10 fire damage, 10 unholy damage
- All party members became **sickened** (ongoing condition, cannot be removed by heal spell in hell)
- Vision: Young adult Thrune fleeing brothel in shame, mocked by prostitutes and friends
- Tower shook again with furious scream

### Bathhouse Discovery
- Pristine ivory walls, warm perfumed air
- Multiple crystal-clear bathing pools of varying depths
- Alabaster statue of beautiful woman holding silver lyre (resembles Thrune's adult sister)
- Luther's true seeing revealed statue animates every 1d3 hours to play lyre

### Nereid Encounter - Narspira
- Luther detected something in deepest pool (30 feet down)
- Creature initially tried to hide but Luther saw through invisibility
- **Narspira**: A nereid (water nymph fey creature) with chaotic good alignment
- Head and neck appear humanoid above water; body is transmuted to water form below surface
- Kidnapped by "being of metal and fire" (likely an iron golem or similar devil construct)
- Forced to sing when lyre plays, causing Thrune pain
- Physical resemblance to Thrune's sister statue - intentional torment
- Luther communicated via monk's Tongues of Sun and Moon ability (speaks to souls directly)
- Party established she was one of two undamned souls
- Luther played Song of Silver badly on the lyre while Narspira sang beautifully
- Performance caused violent shaking and Thrune screamed "NARSALIA!" (presumably sister's name)
- Max successfully plane-shifted her to Kintargo Bay (94% accuracy, within ~20 miles)
- Successfully freed first undamned soul

### Shopping Before Hell
- Liana bought **Rod of Lesser Quicken Metamagic (up to 6th level)** - 75,000gp
- Max bought +7 animated heavy steel shield - 49,000gp
- Max upgraded full plate from +4 to +5
- Luther bought goggles of true seeing
- Max purchased 10,000gp diamond (for true resurrection material component, not consumed unless used)
- Party sold **White Robe of Archmagi** - wrong alignment (white is good-aligned, party needed gray for neutral)
- Each party member received 9,375gp from robe sale (37,500gp / 4)

## Items Acquired

No new permanent items acquired this session (shopping occurred with existing funds).

## NPCs

### Hell NPCs
- **Orgothan** - Pit fiend servant of Mephisto, greeted party at Tower of Bone, provided information about trials
- **Narspira** - Nereid (water nymph fey), kidnapped and forced to torment Thrune with song, rescued by party
- **Half-orc berserker** - Prisoner on torture rack, failed Thrune in Temple of Asmodeus, deserved torment

### Referenced NPCs
- **Mephisto** - Ruler of Cana (8th layer of hell), respects party's accomplishments
- **Captain Sageyta** - Chelish naval officer, "gift" from him (teacup fragments) used as payment
- **Narsalia** (presumed) - Thrune's younger sister, statue resembles her adult form

## Locations

- **Cana** - Eighth layer of hell, ruled by Mephisto
- **Tower of Bone** - Gargantuan structure made of skulls, ribs, femurs, built to torment Thrune and those who failed him
- **Ribway Platform** - Flesh and bone platform where party arrived via gate spell
- **Hall of Penitence** (Floor 1) - Cathedral-like space, 100+ feet tall, walls of compressed bones, five layers of barred cells, torture implements
- **Bathhouse** (Floor 2) - Pristine ivory-walled chamber with warm perfumed air, multiple bathing pools, alabaster statue with silver lyre

## Combat

| Encounter | Result | Notable |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 2 Hamatula (Barbed Devils) | Victory | Max took crits (71 total damage); Liana dealt 129 damage first attack; Luther and Max finished both devils quickly |

## Flaw Tracking

### Max
- **Cruelty** (-2 fortitude saves): From first portal, vision of Thrune vivisecting weasel

### Yzma
- **[Impotence/Shame]** (sickened condition): From second portal, vision of Thrune fleeing brothel in shame

### Luther
- No flaws yet

### Liana
- No flaws yet

**Note**: Sickened condition affects entire party and cannot be removed by magic while in hell.

## Outstanding Tasks

- Navigate remaining six floors/portals of Tower of Bone (currently on floor 2)
- Identify and absorb Thrune's remaining flaws to weaken him (6 more)
- Locate second undamned soul in tower
- Confront Thrune's transformed soul on tower roof (floor 9)
- Return Thrune's heart to his body to prevent Genocide Loki ascension
- Distribute remaining flaws among party (avoid one person taking too many)
- Choose between remaining portal options from bathhouse (C3 and C5 available)

## Strategic Notes

- Mephisto orchestrated contract to ensure Thrune's downfall - all party actions align with his plans
- Party correctly used teacup fragments from Captain Sageyta as "enemy gift" payment
- Tower trials designed as journey of discovery about Thrune's character
- Each absorbed flaw weakens Thrune but burdens party member
- Going blind into situations remains Silver Ravens' tactical approach (for better or worse)
- Luther's goggles of true seeing proving invaluable for detecting illusions/invisibility
- Max experiencing concerning enjoyment of torture that diminishes with repetition
- Party composition: Max (cleric), Yzma (sorcerer), Luther (monk), Liana (ranger/wizard)

## Unresolved Mysteries

- Identity of second undamned soul in tower
- Exact nature of remaining six flaws/trials
- Whether absorbed flaws impose additional mechanical penalties beyond those stated
- What encounters await in remaining floors
- Who was "Narsalia" - Thrune's sister's actual fate unknown
- Why Mephisto chose specifically the Silver Ravens for this task
- What happens after successfully returning heart to Thrune's soul
