# Session: 2026-01-11

## Ongoing Context

**Current Quest**: Seeking the soul-bound phylactery containing Thrune's heart to prevent him from becoming a Genesis Loki.

**Location**: The Darklands, 2,000+ feet beneath Kintargo via the Crypt of Esberdeen ("Mouth of Souls").

**Party Level**: 17

**Party Status**: Max absent this session ("turned into cardboard"); Hero (Fighter NPC) joined as replacement.

**Recent Progress** (from previous session):
- Descended 2,000+ feet into The Darklands
- Defeated **Wormwraith** (ghost dragon) - nasty breath weapons, tough fight
- Found elder red dragon skeleton (killed by lightning, oddly)
- Discovered dragon hoard (noted location, took some treasure)
- Defeated shadow demon panthers and shadow golems
- Golems bore symbols of **Nidel** (neighboring area) and **Ilvarandi family** (pro-Thrune)
- Liana was blinded but healed at Temple Shelleni
- Yzma brought bone dragon powder and horn/tooth samples to surface

**The Pull**: Yzma feels an innate pull toward the heart's location - similar to Professor Mengeoff jar vision.

## Summary

Finalized salvage rights deal with Alabaster Academy - negotiated from initial 3200pp offer to **4000pp** for detailed location description and mining rights to the dragon remains. Rested at headquarters, purchased teleportation scrolls, then returned to The Darklands with Hero (Max absent).

Descended into a grand fungal chamber with glowing spores, then up a staircase to an ancient cathedral. Encountered a female divine entity (hag-like cleric) whose domain was being invaded by Asmodean forces. She requested we purify a soul stone - we believe this is where Thrune's heart is located. In exchange for our help, she provided prayer beads and guided us into the citadel.

Fought through the citadel: Luther quickly dispatched a demon, then we faced an invisible devil. Yzma dispelled the invisibility, and Luther, Hero, and the hag together defeated it.

Disintegrated a wall to discover the **soul anchor** with Thrune's heart mounted inside. Critical revelation: simply returning the heart to Thrune's body in Cheliax won't work - we must travel to Hell to retrieve his soul first.

Consulted the **Font of Visions**: Thrune's soul is imprisoned on the 8th level of Hell, in a tower. Max can prepare Plane Shift to get us there.

Luther helped the hag/cleric "ascend" as she requested (unclear what this means exactly).

**Session ended with clear objective: Plane Shift to the 8th level of Hell to retrieve Thrune's soul.**

## Key Events

1. **Alabaster Academy Deal** - Negotiated salvage rights for dragon remains in The Darklands caverns. Initial offer 3200pp, final deal 4000pp.

2. **Preparation** - Rested at headquarters, purchased teleportation scrolls, recruited Hero to replace absent Max.

3. **Return to The Darklands** - Teleported back to caverns beneath Crypt of Esberdeen.

4. **Grand Fungal Chamber** - Continued descent into chamber with glowing fungus and spores.

5. **Ancient Cathedral** - Ascended staircase to cathedral; met female divine entity/hag-cleric. She warned of Asmodean invaders and requested help purifying the soul stone. Gave us prayer beads; led us into citadel.

6. **Citadel Combat** - Fought demon (Luther took it out quickly), then invisible devil (Yzma dispelled invisibility; Luther, Hero, and hag defeated it together).

7. **Soul Anchor Discovery** - Disintegrated wall to find soul anchor with Thrune's heart mounted inside. Learned we cannot simply return heart to body - must retrieve Thrune's soul from Hell first.

8. **Font of Visions** - Divined Thrune's location: imprisoned in a tower on the 8th level of Hell. Plane Shift (Max can prepare) is how we reach him.

9. **Hag's Ascension** - Luther helped the cleric/hag ascend as she requested. (Nature of this "ascension" unclear.)

- **The Citadel** - Connected to cathedral; contained demons/devils; we fought through it

- **Invisible devil** - Citadel encounter; Yzma dispelled its invisibility; Luther, Hero, and the hag worked together to defeat it

## Outstanding Tasks

**PRIMARY**: Travel to 8th level of Hell via Plane Shift (Max can prepare) to retrieve Thrune's soul from the tower prison

**SECONDARY**:
- Reunite Thrune's soul with his heart and body (in Cheliax) to kill him properly and prevent Genesis Loki transformation
- Determine what to do with the soul anchor (leave intact? destroy?)
- Investigate Ilvarandi family connection to Thrune (golems bore their symbols)

**POSSIBLY RESOLVED**:
- Asmodean invader threat in cathedral (may have been addressed by helping the hag/cleric)

## Unresolved Mysteries

**From Previous Sessions**:
- What killed the elder red dragon with lightning?
- What tore apart the humanoids in the rage chamber? (Dragon was already dead)
- Why were valuable Nidel constructs placed in these caverns?
- Were the demon panthers native or placed intentionally?

**From This Session**:
- Who exactly is the female hag/cleric entity? What does "ascend" mean - did she die? Transform? Leave this plane?
- How did Asmodean forces learn about or gain access to this ancient cathedral?
- Why is Thrune's soul imprisoned on the 8th level of Hell specifically?
- What is the full sequence needed: retrieve soul from Hell -> reunite with heart -> return to body -> kill properly?
