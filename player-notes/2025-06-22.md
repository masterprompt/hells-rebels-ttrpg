- Thrune is technically dead (body)
- Found demon who wrote Kintargo contract
- **Moostaphelies** (Lord of 8th layer of Hell) wrote heart's harvest contract
- Must return heart to Thrune's body, then kill him again to prevent him becoming a **Genesis Loki**

## Clockwork Heart Cage Investigation (Lucky Bones Base)

Hidden conditions discovered:
