## Tactical Notes

### For the Hell Trip
- **Dispel Evil** (1): Extremely relevant - banishes evil outsiders on touch. Save for a critical moment.
- **Teleport** (5): Won't work across planes, but useful for movement within a plane of Hell.
- **Heal** (2): 150 HP emergency healing, no questions asked.
- **Restoration** (1): Negative levels are common from undead/fiends. Critical to have.
- **Remove Curse** (4): Devils love curses. Well-stocked here.
- **See Invisibility** (2): Devils frequently use invisibility and greater invisibility.
- **Callback** (4): Put on party members before combat; they auto-teleport to Yzma when hit. Good for regrouping.

### General Use
- **Hidden Presence**: Only 2 min duration - use for quick infiltration, not sustained stealth.
- **Invisibility Alarm**: Set up around camp/rest areas to detect invisible scouts.
- **Water Breathing**: 6-hour duration with 4 scrolls means the whole party can go aquatic for extended periods.
