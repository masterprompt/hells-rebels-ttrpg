## Character Background: Yzma

*Child of Kintargo trait*: Born into House Tennessan (minor noble family). Father is Geoff Tennessan, a powerful mage and practiced swordsman. Unlike older brothers and cousin, Geoff is not a blind Thrune fanatic. Yzma's natural magical affinity (vs. studied magic) caused siblings to bully and outcast her.
