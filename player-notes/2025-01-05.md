## Summary

Investigation into drow presence. Met Lady Delacour, investigated Flynn's disappearance, and traced evidence through the city.

## Lady Delacour Meeting (V1 District)

- Runs a girls' school (formerly etiquette for nobles, now open to all bloodlines)
- Yzma allowed in; Max and Gorlin waited outside
- Claims no knowledge of drow in city
- Will keep eyes/ears open
- Party suspects drow may be working with Asmodeus followers

## Flynn Investigation

### Clench-Jaw Tavern
- Met with Clenchjaw about Flynn (missing several days)
- Found signs of struggle in Flynn's room
- Clues: blood spatter, odd shallow acid burns on furniture (cleaned)
- Happened a couple days ago

### Temple of Shalenlae (T4)
- Went to discuss scrying for Flynn
- Clerics noted Gorlon's aura is "out of alignment"
- Gorlon's ritual: Get "happy water" from city, meditate until it turns red
- Result: Gorlon now has 5% chance to cast fire magic

### Scrying Results (Max)
- Flynn has purposeful injuries (healing/stitching)
- Either torture or body modification
- Possibly in dark temple
- Cots with dead people; Flynn tortured on one
- Cannot teleport to Flynn (blocked)

## City Investigation

- Walked city using Detect Magic for teleport barriers
- Went to mages school: got **Arcane Sight permanently** on Yzma
- Temple district temples (3 major): Asmodeus, Shalenlae, Zokotol (Shadow Lord)
- Abjuration and Evocation detected from all temples

## Day 4 (3 days until negotiations)

- Sent raven to Flynn and followed it
- Received anonymous note: "gift left in your temple"
- Searched hideout - nothing
- Checked Temple of Aroden (being remodeled): Found **Flynn dead on table**
- Someone moved Flynn there; faint conjuration aura similar to Clove and Hoof murder scene

### Commune with Birds Results
- Whoever delivered body no longer in town
- Many dead bodies in shadow temple (may not be where Flynn held)
- All birds scared of shadow temple (T1) and something in lower V5

### Flynn's Body
- Exploded when picked up
- **Silver Butcher's Axe** found propping up body (rare weapon)
- Took Flynn's remains for future resurrection

- Black market investigation:
  - Obsidian elf bought axe
  - Described as "artist in killing"
  - Had companion; both now gone
  - Suggestion: Check **Alabaster Academy**
