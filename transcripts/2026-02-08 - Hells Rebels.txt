Speaker 1
That's...

Speaker 2
Hey, there it is.

Speaker 1
The cave. That is a hell of a lot closer to where we left off than I thought we'd be.

Speaker 2
Thank you.

Speaker 1
So that's the good news.

Speaker 3
The bad news is... You guys did defeat it together. It was then decided that you would return to the surface to recuperate and recover. I'll be back.

Speaker 2
Keep going.

Speaker 3
Max, use greater teleport right before you turn cardboard-ist. Back up to the surface. Y'all rested.

Speaker 2
Lots of rest. Had to do the rest.

Speaker 3
Had to do the rest. Recuperate your spells, recuperate your level losses.

Speaker 2
Hit points, all that jazz.

Speaker 3
Hit points, everything. I believe there was a ritual for your character, Liana, who was performed at the Temple of Shalane.

Speaker 2
First of all, yeah, I paid for stuff.

Speaker 3
Yeah, because they had to remove probably your lost levels because you got hit with breath quick, I think twice. Or if not, you got level drained twice. I think it's best for him to hear the recap because he missed the best. You guys returned via teleport and to the south of where you guys fought the dragon, you found a tunnel that led to the dragon's horde. Okay. Max, as cardboard-itis, was subtly turned away from the horde by Yzma and then returned back to face the horde again and everything was gone in bags of holding that he didn't see totally totally um i think he got all of it in the bags of holding if not a large portion of it it was a ridiculously high number and i bet chris was the one who wrote it down so i don't know how much money you got from that i could do some all the money yeah do you recall how much money his share is um because I'm unless Casey took notes on the treasure yeah usually Chris did so that's why I

Speaker 2
assumed it was Chris yeah I've got the thousand platinum pieces from bonus each that's what I've

Speaker 3
written now oh yeah that was talking about before that that was a fragment yeah if you're talking

Speaker 2
about before that I had stuff from December but that's the last time I have anything recorded so

Speaker 3
The 1,000 platinum pieces came from the Academy, and that was for mining rights to the remains of the dragon. That was still left, the bones. Luther collected a fang, and maybe a claw as well, for himself. And the mining rights to the remains of the dragon were sold to the Alabaster Academy for another portion of treasure. so you have at least a thousand platinum pieces plus the actual horde they continued down to the west

Speaker 4
with slight

Speaker 3
descending and came across a gorge where two shadow golems raised and a pack of night prowlers attacked from the far side. The hard-fought battle was...

Speaker 4
Sorry, you made mention of the 4,000 platinum, right?

Speaker 3
4,000, well, 1,000 platinum each.

Speaker 4
Yeah, that's what I meant.

Speaker 3
Yeah. So that money's 1,000 platinum, plus the actual dragon horde, which we're still getting the total of.

Speaker 1
To be fair, I'm still trying to find my character. Because I had it perfectly saved. I just don't know where to put it. Which is highly irritating because...

Speaker 3
The Shadow Golems did some damage to you guys. They had strength-based breath weapon, or strength-training breath weapons, which hurt Luthor and maybe hurt you guys too. I don't remember if I hit both or either of you with a strength ring breath weapon. The Nightcrawlers came around the edge of, followed the trail around the gorge, and started attacking you two because they moved right past Luther, who was busy with the golems. So Luther took on the golems because they were highly magic resistant, And you two got face to face with some actual Puma-sized shadow creatures. Oh, even bigger than Puma's. Tiger-sized. You guys then decided to rest and back up to the surface world with your found treasure. Recovered from your damages and whatnot, then decided to come back down again. Entered a large chamber to the continuing west and then finally north. To the large chamber known as the Soulbound facade. sod. A huge citadel set at the north end of this and a spiked building to the west, much smaller than the citadel. There you met a witch fire, a former hag who was... She was so nice. She was nice. You guys actually like, diplomatized and got an ally out of her.

Speaker 1
Are you guys feeling okay? Diplomasizing accurately without killing someone?

Speaker 3
Well, you see...

Speaker 2
It was mean for a change! What happened?

Speaker 3
She couldn't enhance the witch fire. It doesn't have any pants, so... I tried the other method. Diplomacy. Weird. And allied with the witch fire... Have you been replaced by a pod person? No, she's been replaced by a pod person. She opens up her chest and it's just the well-can-pain. Will comes out with... - - Will's drink. - Willis has joined the party. In my Lyanna golem.

Speaker 2
- Yeah, that's...

Speaker 3
- That's not creepy at all. - Oh, it was intended to be. - Nespira offered you some prayer beads from her corpse, Yzma, after you impressed her with your silver tongue. phrasing. And you guys entered the citadel. She was highly offended that it was contaminated with a tumor and was powerless to remove it herself as she is unbed. Inside, a nemesis devil awaited you and um demon yes a demon a nemesis demon devil was uh awaiting you and it's who can do all of them had summoned a uh horned devil to help it in its escapades of fighting off the intruders. But once both of those were dispatched, you found a solid rock wall where Nespira had told you where the sole anchor was. The fiend had created stone walls to prevent you guys from entering and removing the "tumor" from the soul anchor. This was easily dispatched by Yzma Disintegrate, the best way to solve any puzzle.

Speaker 1
It solves a remarkable variety of them.

Speaker 3
This time no trap was triggered though, so even better. When the soul anchor was revealed, the swirling energies of afterlife, not unlife, swirled about the beating heart of Brasali Thrun, Luther said, "Well, this is what we're here for," and reached in and grabbed it himself with very little hesitation. He now has the beating heart of Brizali through. As a thank you for removing the tumor from the soul anchor, Nespira took you to the hag's eye as an attempt to pay off her debt to your group. It takes you to the font of visions and reveals the location of Brizali Thrun through the powerful artifact. And since she was a worshipper of Mahatula, she didn't have her soul sucked into the mirrors above. Which could have happened to you guys, but didn't. She was then laid to rest by Lyanna with her holy symbol. And you guys returned to the... you might still be down there. Either you returned to the surface or you're still down there. The image of Rizali Thrun has been burned into your minds. His new form is on top of a large spire in... What you guys... Do we have any knowledge plans, Roald? We did not, actually. We did not. A large spire is where he's atop of. But we assume it was hell. We know a Charlotte who knows that such things. Yes, there's...

Speaker 2
I've got knowledge points.

Speaker 3
There are at least nine layers of hell. That was the eighth. We determined. You did determine? Oh, okay. I take that.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I've got it in the notes, so we determined it was the eighth.

Speaker 3
That's the eighth level of hell.

Speaker 4
Our clear objective was to plain shift to the eighth level of hell to retrieve the soul.

Speaker 3
His body, though still recognizable as Brasali, has been horribly melted away, I guess is the best way to describe it. Large portions of his skin and muscles are deteriorated, leaving a bony-like skeletal man that is still recognizable as Brasali Thrun, but a fearsome horror of a being.

Speaker 1
He got some hypnotism. I mean...

Speaker 3
I'll just read the description of him now. The features of this once-proud inquisitor are vaguely recognizable, even without the flesh that once clad his bones. His body, now infernally horrific, is chained and broken, and exudes an almost overwhelming sense of menace and power.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
I do believe... And Max recovered from his card for a nice. I do believe we need a character.

Speaker 1
Somewhat. Unfortunately for all that I'm here, I have no idea. He's not yet here.

Speaker 5
With all my experience, we need a jar of dirt. I saw it in the movie. A what? A jar. A jar. A dirt. Oh. For the heart.

Speaker 3
I was mid-coffing. I had to laugh at the same time. That was awful. That actually burned my throat. We can do both those at the same time. I've got a jar of dirt. I've got a jar of dirt.

Speaker 2
Always wanting to carry out a jar of dirt.

Speaker 4
I'm good. I can't have any of it.

Speaker 2
Sure? He's on his... He's on his eye for a good thing with flavor.

Speaker 4
It's just whole food only, uh. I thought you were done with it. Nope, it lasts for like, a couple months.

Speaker 5
Oh. I thought it was just until the end of, uh, January.

Speaker 4
No, no. You don't go...

Speaker 5
Potatoes. Oh.

Speaker 4
Potatoes is only two weeks, but everything else is... Oh. a couple months. - That's really too bad because

Speaker 5
- I know, these are amazing. - These are, you can only get them on the East Coast. I had a special order.

Speaker 4
- Really? - Really.

Speaker 2
- And they're so good. - He's like, well, I'll be good for chips for a while. I said, why? He's like, cause I had to buy a case. - I had to buy a case in a case. - Oh, what's that?

Speaker 1
- Well, I am confused, but I'll take it.

Speaker 5
- And they're like sweet, they're sweet and spicy. - They're like, it's just right. - Yeah.

Speaker 3
- Sure, I haven't had these before. - Oh, I-- - Here, hold the cord. - It's--

Speaker 5
- I've never been heard. - I, when we were in Indianapolis, there was a food cart that sold sandwiches, and these were the chicks they gave out with them. And it was-- - Oh, they're so good.

Speaker 2
- I don't like them because I'm not a spicy person, but-- - Oh, right, sweet.

Speaker 5
- Yep. - But I have a nice bite on the back end.

Speaker 1
Well, I am very confused, but I'll take it. Apparently the same file from Google Drive was actually up to date. It just said it was from 2023. Weird.

Speaker 3
Just double check your highest level spells to make sure. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Prismatic Spear? Well, it says I'm level... Yeah, I have Miracle and Prismatic Spear, so I'm good. As my 9th level spells. *laughs*

Speaker 5
So you guys find yourself in the... I'm also in the middle of trying to get our room situated for Gen Con. And something tells me that we might not be in there.

Speaker 2
No!

Speaker 5
I'm still trying to get into the server.

Speaker 2
- This is one of the beeswax.

Speaker 3
- Was it not available until--

Speaker 5
- Well, so because of the VIG, we get early access to housing. - But vendors get first choice. - But right now for some reason--

Speaker 3
- So everyone who is getting in early is getting in right now, huh?

Speaker 5
- Yes, even among people who have full early access, you're not guaranteed a hotel that you actually want,

Speaker 2
which is great. I'd like something with a two block radius because we walk. Anything more than that, we'd have to take like, we'd have to take those little, they have the little scooters, but I fell off one and went ass over tea kettle on my road one. And I've been a little hesitant and our other friend wiped out on one last year.

Speaker 5
She ended up in an emergency room.

Speaker 2
Yeah, she thought she broke something in her face.

Speaker 5
So, I ride them, and I'm very confident in riding them, and I'm like jumping curves and shit. She followed me, and I ran up a curve and then jumped off, and she was going to try the same thing. And it hit the wheel. When she jumped off, her wheel went sideways, and she just went right over. Oh, God. Face planted into the concrete.

Speaker 2
Mine was a choice between that or getting arrested, so. I'm gonna get arrested. - Because there was a cop sitting right there and I could've hit a pedestrian and that would've ended for a problem.

Speaker 3
- Nah, only for the pedestrian. - You got your getaway vehicle.

Speaker 2
- So, Chris is going and his is going at full clip and I'm trying to keep up and I'm failing 'cause this thing is a piece of shit. And as I'm turning, all of a sudden, people start walking across the street. I'm like, "Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit." It will not let me stop. So my option is either to run into the curves or to hit the people. So I ran into the curve and went, at least I tucked and rolled. But I did, I bruised ribs and, yeah, it was pretty bad. I was in pain for a couple of days. Thankfully, it was like what, it was late on Saturday. So we had Sunday and then healing at work at home.

Speaker 3
Fair, fair. So yeah, um... You find yourselves in front of the citadel of Mahatula. Okay.

Speaker 2
The citadel.

Speaker 3
The citadel.

Speaker 5
Okay. Just in time. Get us out of here.

Speaker 1
The first thing...

Speaker 3
The first thing we can say to Max. Oh, good, you're back. We need to go. My ride's here, everyone.

Speaker 1
I gotta go.

Speaker 5
So we need to go plane shift or something? No, just home. Okay. Not for nuts. We're kind of beat the fuck up. That sucks.

Speaker 2
We went home to heal.

Speaker 5
And then we came back down and got whooped again. There has been a theme.

Speaker 1
Okay, well. I can simply just teleport us home.

Speaker 3
Where do you teleport?

Speaker 1
Outside. I'm going to do the... Where is that? I have the... No, I'm not going to teleport to the area we can't teleport to. I know that much.

Speaker 3
I always have to ask.

Speaker 1
No, no, I'm using the one that brings me back to the temple.

Speaker 5
Right.

Speaker 1
Because that one doesn't have any mischance. Also, it's a 5th level spell slot for me. And it works in your player.

Speaker 5
The only reason... Oh, we're just in the undergar.

Speaker 1
Oh yeah, no, no, this one's just really, really good, but it's an abadar-specific spell. So yeah, I will bring us back to the Kaudi room. So, you guys need some healing?

Speaker 3
Some of them do.

Speaker 2
Did I pay for that shit? We already took it all.

Speaker 3
We're all ready to go. Like, we're all set. I thought we were... Did we do another next day? Because you guys definitely used spells.

Speaker 5
Yeah.

Speaker 3
Because we were... Unless we... I'll let you grab you back up to the surface and rested for the night.

Speaker 5
I thought we just pretty much ended it at... We got the heart. And got the location.

Speaker 3
We might have hand waved you guys going back up to the surface and patching yourselves up.

Speaker 1
Well, I mean the thing is, since I wasn't there for the fight, I have plenty of magic to heal you guys to full. Pretty much just about everything.

Speaker 3
Yeah, use all your magic then go to hell.

Speaker 1
I mean, but we're going to stay the night anyways. Because you guys are beat to shit spell-wise.

Speaker 2
So, I didn't actually use that many spells.

Speaker 3
Well, you used at least a disintegrate. I used... You used spell magic...

Speaker 4
Oh yeah, I used 1 level 8th and 2 level 2's so... I mean I'm not terrible, I... If you want to rest I'm fine with it, I just...

Speaker 5
I need to rest. Okay, well... I didn't mean to... I used... I used... All this spells of punch. Yeah, I used all my spells. All your ki? Uh, no, I... I used about 70% of my ki.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 5
Because I... I had to use... Self-restoration.

Speaker 1
Oh, sure.

Speaker 5
Well...

Speaker 3
Yeah, that's right. The monk of self, I'm better than you.

Speaker 1
But yeah, I mean, if anyone has any ability damage or any other random conditions, most all of them can be fixed with heal spot.

Speaker 3
There was some strength damage from the shadow goal.

Speaker 5
Yeah, that's what I fixed.

Speaker 1
Okay. Is there anything else anyone needs? Because, I mean, so far all I've done is spend the 5th level spell slot. So, I'm happy to go on this stuff right away, so.

Speaker 5
I just need...

Speaker 2
I think I used some Cure stuff before, so I think I'm good.

Speaker 5
I need rest to just redo my...

Speaker 1
Okay, so sure.

Speaker 5
I'll be good in about, I'll be good in like 4 hours.

Speaker 3
Monks are so weird.

Speaker 1
They are.

Speaker 3
So, I'll go to Koma. Just right there in the counting house. Just be like, ah, night guys.

Speaker 1
Good enough. Okay, so.

Speaker 4
Well. I have a robe of Archmagi. Would you like to have that? Probably.

Speaker 2
Is that one of those things that we had no idea what to do with it?

Speaker 3
No. It's a very useful thing. No, we gave it to him.

Speaker 4
I realize my Arcane Bloodline Rogue is much better. What color is it? The what? The robe? Yes. I think it was purple. Let me check. It's white.

Speaker 1
Oh, white. It was white, yeah.

Speaker 2
But you tie-dye it. Great.

Speaker 1
No, no, no. I don't have a vegetable diet. We're great. Well, no, no, the problem is, if it's white, it doesn't do me any good. It only works for your... They're very alignment-based. Yeah, it's a white. Yeah, I would need a gray one.

Speaker 2
So it's a good chance that I lost dice underneath that table. We'll look later.

Speaker 3
There is another chaotic character in the party. That also casts arcane spells. Marius? I was thinking someone at the table.

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. You could wear it. It would actually... I don't know that would be...

Speaker 5
Yeah, I cast arcane spells. Really? Yes. You want to wear it? I got one. I have a sleep. It gives you spell resistance. The crazy part is my monk robes are better than that robe for me. I was talking about Lyanna guys. Well, the problem is her... She's a wizard.

Speaker 2
But I got my Celestial Armor and then I got my flaming cloak.

Speaker 1
Well, yeah, it's all the things it does are good. However, it's not worth the 75 grand cost to buy one. No, but we have one. No, what I mean is, it's not actually that good for...

Speaker 2
It's not good for you, it causes cancer.

Speaker 1
Well, first question is, are you good?

Speaker 3
Dang it, they're on to me. I gave them all 3 items, I gave them cancer. That's how the campaign ends, guys. 12 years after.

Speaker 5
Leukemia, we all got it. So you could at least wear it.

Speaker 2
I got plenty of stuff, I'm fine.

Speaker 1
Really, all it would do for you is plus 2 enhancement boost to your castle level checks to overcome spell resistance.

Speaker 2
I'm good. I'm alright.

Speaker 3
I give her spell resistance.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I give her that too, but spell resistance to 18 at this level is useless. Everyone adds their level as a modifier. So anything we're fighting at anywhere near our level has to roll 2 to not fail. So it's kind of a case of... Spell resistance 18 sounds amazing, but by the time you can afford the robe it's absolutely useless. To anyone who has a caster level that's anywhere near their level.

Speaker 3
Unless she doesn't have any rub at all. In which case... It doesn't hurt.

Speaker 1
It doesn't hurt. It's just almost useless. Fine. I would have to roll one which would still succeed. To overcome that spell resistance.

Speaker 3
Nah. That's a fail. Not on spell resistance. It's like armor. Is it? Rolling in that 20 will hit.

Speaker 1
I thought it wasn't like that. As far as this one's just spell armor. Kind of.

Speaker 3
I guess. Power of the world.

Speaker 1
Anyways.

Speaker 3
Any of you, what do you guys do? You guys are back up to the surface. Luther may or may not have just gone comatose. Sounds like Luther went comatose. I'm not entirely sure if that's what is joking or if that's just like night guys and just went tomatose right there.

Speaker 5
I'm not going to go back and get all ready on this one. I'm going to go back to my room, then I'm going to go tomatose. Boom. Oh, we got, ah, we need a freaking place to put this heart on. What do we need to do to it? Take it to hell?

Speaker 2
Can't we wrap it in something, like something holy or something?

Speaker 1
Well, wait, how about a rope of the Arkham region? Well, no, no, what would be funny is if that counts as him wearing it, that gives him a minus two to everything. Because he's wearing a robe that's of the wrong color.

Speaker 2
That's true. That's so true. Let's try it anyways. That's the other thing that happens. It doesn't work.

Speaker 3
Everything just implodes on itself.

Speaker 1
Well, it would effectively just curse him with a minus two level drain. Assuming that causes him wearing it.

Speaker 3
Just imagine like, hey, we got this real powerful 75,000 gold thing. What do we want to do with it? Let's wrap this bloody heart in it. Okay. I got a backpack, guys. No, no, no. Put it in the backpack. It won't work. It won't go into an interdimensional space.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 5
That I do.

Speaker 2
What's your address, Matt? 31? That's.

Speaker 1
He did learn that. 31, 37, South 106th Street.

Speaker 5
Doom, doom. Doom, doom.

Speaker 3
Yeah, how are you carrying the heart? Just doom. Under the arm? I mean, like, where is it currently? Just like a regular heart, right? Or is it like giant? No, it's like a human heart. Just put it in a pocket. It's in my pocket. My question is, because you're going to be walking the public streets, how are you carrying this heart?

Speaker 5
We're in a sack, I guess.

Speaker 3
Okay. I just wanted to know if Luther just didn't care and was carrying the heart like a parade float. Just like, hey guys, check this out. Luther just runs around the city with a different heart.

Speaker 5
You're never going to believe it. It still makes noise.

Speaker 1
I'm not even squeezing it. So, what are we doing with the heart? We're bringing it to hell. But what effect does that have? I don't know. This was something we were told, I just don't remember.

Speaker 5
I am certain that I was told by an elf who was a know-it-all exactly what we were supposed to do with it.

Speaker 3
Everyone make a wisdom or intelligence check.

Speaker 1
Unless Casey has it in his notes, where Casey automatically passes.

Speaker 4
What was the question? I'm sorry. What are you doing with the heart? Oh, we have to put it back in his body, but we need his soul back.

Speaker 2
We have to find his soul, too?

Speaker 4
We know where his soul is. It's in the body.

Speaker 5
It's in hell.

Speaker 4
Yeah. But we can't put his heart back into his body until we have the soul. We know that. Because remember, we asked that thing. Grabbing notes here.

Speaker 1
The devil lawyer? Or someone else?

Speaker 4
Or the hague scryer? We consulted the font of visions.

Speaker 1
Oh yes, the Hanksgrider.

Speaker 4
Yeah. Thrun's soul is imprisoned in the 8th level of hell in a tower. And we need that because it's a bad idea to put the heart back into the body without the soul.

Speaker 3
No, that wasn't the question that you asked. What was the question? The question you asked is, can we destroy the heart? And that's when you got the bad to do from your circulate. To do. The all-knowing, after several hours of description on how this contract actually works, finally gets to the point that you asked him about four hours ago. Putting the heart, returning the heart to Thrun will prevent the Genocide Loki ascension. Oh, okay. So returning the heart to Thrun.

Speaker 1
Because he has a heartless, he did some sort of heartless ritual or something. Yes, I have critical revelation.

Speaker 4
Simply returning the heart to Thrun's body in Chellix won't work. We must travel to hell to retrieve the soul.

Speaker 3
Yes, because they were going to find the body of Thrun, which was sent back to. Which was sent return to the capital of Chellix. So the plan was that they were going to just go back to the body, put the heart in. But that's... And that was... That's not enough. No, that was not... Not wise. Yeah, that didn't matter. Okay. I mean, you could do it, but it won't have any effect on the genocide Loki ascension. Okay. As his soul and body are now one in hell. Oh. As all outsiders, their soul and body is one thing instead of two. Mm-hmm. I'm like immortals. Okay. Wow. Are those onions? Yes, yes, they are.

Speaker 1
They were, but I closed them back up. Yeah. I'm like,

Speaker 4
one at a time. I'm glad I'm way over here from y'all.

Speaker 2
I don't care. I like the smell of onions. It's right up there with gasoline and sunscreen.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. The whole thing she's not supposed to smell.

Speaker 2
White out. White out.

Speaker 1
Perfume. Gasoline and onions.

Speaker 2
And white out.

Speaker 1
It reminds me of the cologne scents of motor oil

Speaker 3
fresh cut grass. Motor oil and uh and onions. That's all you want? We call it motor oil onion. I like some. Okay. Motor onions. Something like that. Rub it on your wrists and it'll last all day. Oh wow. So you guys rest for the day to recover spells and or key and or hit points and or anything? And you wake up the next day. Ready to go to hell.

Speaker 4
As they would say. I mean would you say that? I don't know. I'm ready to go hell.

Speaker 1
There are certain spells we really don't want to be hit by. Do we know what they are? I'm good with all of them Well I can't do all of them

Speaker 3
I'm a monk I can take any spell You know what else I can do? Fall asleep in a coma You know what else I can do? Heal myself completely Also I'm a monk I can teleport Well no Mumps are weird That's my point

Speaker 1
No I have something called spell immunity Where I can basically pick some spells In this case it's four spells and we're just completely immune to them. We just need to know which ones. That's kind of the problem.

Speaker 3
To Luther, you're fighting demons, so whatever anti-demon spell...

Speaker 1
Well, it's not... It's the spells... The problem is, we don't know what they've been using. I mean... Honestly... It doesn't... That is the biggest problem.

Speaker 5
So far, I've yet to have a problem getting hit by a spell.

Speaker 3
Yeah, so far, Luther doesn't care because he's a goddamn monk. I mean, I get it. I get it.

Speaker 5
Um, I would, I guess like, if we don't like, don't like, like, like banishment, let's not get banished out of hell. That's easy. If that's a thing that, that, that, that, that'd be a go-to for, for us. Like, so if they don't want us there.

Speaker 3
That's a go-to for certain party members, yes.

Speaker 5
So, if we don't want to get sent back to hell, or sent back from hell, sent back, so we have to do this again, I guess banishment would be one? I suppose I could do that.

Speaker 1
Something with fire? Oh, okay. That's fair.

Speaker 3
I like how spellcaster, spellcaster, spellcaster. Luther is the one who thinks of banishment. Let's have an anti-banishment set on us. Anti-banishment. Yeah.

Speaker 5
Well, because we don't be outsiders. If it's an outsider, you cast banishment on them. They go back to wherever they came from. We'd be the outsider, and we'd be sent back to where we came from.

Speaker 2
Oh, gosh, gosh.

Speaker 5
Okay. Which in...

Speaker 2
I'm like, we're only casting stuff on ourselves for us.

Speaker 5
Which wouldn't be the worst for us, but we just wouldn't be where we need to be.

Speaker 1
Well, that means I can't use my backup, backup, backup, play shift.

Speaker 2
Which is banishing ourselves so we can get out of there? Yes.

Speaker 3
The problem with banishment, though, for In One Hood's Spellcraft... It's random. Yeah, you end up back on the material world. Well, somewhere. It doesn't mean you return back to where you were.

Speaker 2
No, no, that's why it's my backup, backup, backup. That's where you came from.

Speaker 3
You go back to the world. You don't go back to where you were.

Speaker 1
Unfortunately, almost all of the plane ships are random. So, except for Word of Recall, which I have two of, which is not random, it's to that temple. And normally speaking, it's on the plane. It's just, Abadar's version is, don't care. You're home. Abadar don't care. He's a god of travel. You want to go somewhere?

Speaker 3
You go somewhere.

Speaker 1
He's a god of travel in cities. You go specifically back to this city.

Speaker 3
Any other preparations? Or any preparations at all? I don't know if you actually cast these.

Speaker 1
I am going to have the communal smell of immunity available. Unfortunately, it doesn't, like we said, it's super situational. So. But yeah, I'm going to have to cast it as a... I'll probably extend it to be longer. If I want to do that. But yeah, I'll... I don't know. Okay. Yeah, unfortunately, part of what I've done is I've left like three quarters of my spells just not prepared so I can actually be flexible and stuff. Because unfortunately, that's the biggest issue with clerics is they have a spell for everything however I only have one ninth level spell slot so I grab the implosion remember how much fun destruction is implosion is the ninth level version concentration for up to one round per two levels um I point at someone um and they make a fortitude save if they if they fail the save they take um 170 damage. Unfortunately it only works on one character at a time or one character uh each character once but you can hit multiple enemies once per round with it.

Speaker 3
These are some of the suggestions.

Speaker 2
What do you do?

Speaker 3
Sorry, Cana, not Nessus. Nessus is the 9 player. Cana is the 8.

Speaker 1
Okay, so we're going to be teleporting to Hell, or plane shifting to Hell. Oh, that's minutes per level? Yeah, okay.

Speaker 4
I thought so. Huh? I thought we were doing it.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 4
Any objections?

Speaker 2
For what? Going?

Speaker 4
Yeah, to hell.

Speaker 2
In a handbasket, you gotta bring a handbasket.

Speaker 3
I'll bring a handbasket. You have to get in the handbasket. So it has to be a pretty large handbasket.

Speaker 1
Well, traditional, I suppose. Is that the tuning fork for the plane shift spell? Because you need one for every plane. So, presumably, the focus for this one is a handbasket. I have no focus to go to hell.

Speaker 3
I like it.

Speaker 1
I mean, they just say it's a fork, mill, rod, but what fun is that?

Speaker 3
Yeah, every plane should have its own unique one because that's funnier. Rule of cool.

Speaker 1
Yes. I mean, it doesn't have a cost listed, so it's obviously zero. But yeah, a handbasket does make the most entertaining sense.

Speaker 2
That's a handbasket of holding. That'd be hilarious.

Speaker 3
Yes, my handbasket of holding that happens. It just slurps everything in the area. There is no cover! How do we close it? Alright, so how are you guys getting there?

Speaker 1
What are you going to do? Unless I wanted to prep gate.

Speaker 5
Give me one second. I got into the fucking portal right now.

Speaker 1
Okay, of course.

Speaker 4
I thought we were just going to... You were just going to plane shift, right?

Speaker 5
I am going to go and spend my money. I want to get one thing. Because I'm going to spend the bulk of my money to get goggles or trucey. Okay. Because we're going to hell. And I'm assuming it's going to be dark and or blinding and or whatever. And that should cover me.

Speaker 1
That's fair. I should probably spend money before we go. Just saying. Yeah, rather than implosion, as much fun as implosion would be, I'll grab gate. What? I know, I know. How would you give him something so awesome?

Speaker 3
Because he needs a spell to get him there.

Speaker 1
Because I want the one spell that lets you go between dimensions and go there. Because, I mean, this would let us say, hey, we want to go specifically to Thrun's prison. we go there, I think. In a plane you specify... Oh, well that would be funny.

Speaker 3
If you have the cache, you could have a temple cascade.

Speaker 1
Well, what would actually be funny is we can name a particular being and call him possibly. The question is, is he trapped enough that we couldn't just gate him here?

Speaker 3
Make a knowledge.

Speaker 1
Charlotte. Planes or Spellcraft. Spellcraft I can do. Theoretically. Very theoretically. 22.

Speaker 4
29. Yeah.

Speaker 3
His diabolical form, as you saw, was bound to the tower. Okay, so odds are he's stuck. Odds are someone wants him to stay there. Uh-huh. And that someone is probably pretty powerful.

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, that works. Player travel works exactly where you want.

Speaker 3
Player travel?

Speaker 1
The player travel mode of gate.

Speaker 5
Oh, yes.

Speaker 1
You may hold the round open only a brief time. But...

Speaker 3
What? You can't just permanently make a gate open?

Speaker 1
Well, it's rounds per level hold held open. Presumably there's a way to do it permanently as a ritual type epic type thing. But it's a 9th level spell. You're not going to do this.

Speaker 3
you're not just going to open the gates of hell permanently is that what you're telling me what how'd you know you're right dang it that was the culmination of this entire campaign actually is to open a permanent portal to hell

Speaker 1
right here in Quintardo so how much money do I have because theoretically lots yeah I should buy something um considering this is probably one of the last times I mean, I suppose that would be a...

Speaker 3
I have a calculator. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I have a calculator. You have one-fourth of 71,000 gold pieces, one-fourth of 51,000 gold pieces.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay. That looks right. One second here. Let me just start. That looks right. 17, 750. One second here. I'm just going to start adding these. So there's 10K from the platinum.

Speaker 3
Not from gold pieces.

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. That platinum. Yeah. Those are both gold pieces. 17, 750. And you have one-fourth of 5,300 platinum pieces.

Speaker 1
Okay, one second here. There was the 71,000. What's the 50-something?

Speaker 3
51,000. Oh, shit.

Speaker 1
I divided it by four twice. So 12, 750. Okay. 12 to... Okay, and then there was the platinum pieces. How many? 5,300 platinum pieces.

Speaker 3
one-fourth of that um 13 250 and then the uh the a thousand platinum pieces as well

Speaker 1
yeah you've got 57 000 gold because i was below before um

Speaker 3
okay that doesn't include anything that the party might have sold since then

Speaker 1
um did we want to solve that rope of the archway jay yeah it's what 75 000 divided by eight um four is party size eight is half the party is 50 value so 9 375 gold each Oh dear God, $60,000 in gold. Okay, what on earth do I want to buy?

Speaker 4
So, you got about an eight, you said? Mm-hmm. And what was that?

Speaker 2
$9,375. Correct. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3
Economics is ridiculous.

Speaker 4
I'm going to get that off my...

Speaker 2
Pass this over to Ian, please. Hopefully it stays up on the screen.

Speaker 1
Wilk.

Speaker 2
Is that about right? Is that about right?

Speaker 1
Sure. Sure.

Speaker 2
Because that's what I pictured.

Speaker 3
That is fun. I do like the vote for Wilk button that they just added on top. I put it in there as a piece of button.

Speaker 1
Button that says vote for Wilk. So something you could pick up that would be helpful to you, Michelle, is a Quicken Metamagic Rod Lesser for $35,000. A what? Quicken Metamagic Rod. What it would let you do is cast any of your spells as a swift action up to third level. Because normally you're shooting stuff.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
You're not using your swift action for anything.

Speaker 2
No.

Speaker 1
So being able to do haste on the party as a swift action and then shoot. Or any of your third level spells like flight or any of that. Invisibility just as a swift action three times a day.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
But that's 35,000. the better version is 75 000 for up to six level okay might be worth for if you don't have something better to buy with your money casey what's that i'm sorry if you okay if you're looking for something to spend money on i'm always going to be 75 000 i'm like the quick one it's on you I know if the stairs come back down, I'm like, onion! It goes up to 6 levels.

Speaker 4
Well, monk onion. I don't have a magic rod, let me take a look.

Speaker 1
What's it called? Quick action? Quicken, metamagic rod. Lesser.

Speaker 3
I need one of those.

Speaker 4
I got a lesser maximize.

Speaker 3
You spent all your money on... I did spend all my money on that.

Speaker 2
I have a rod of lesser Quicken. You said the 75,000 is the better one?

Speaker 1
Is the better one. That goes up to 6th level.

Speaker 5
A good chunk of my money, I should say. I'm not broke.

Speaker 2
I'm close.

Speaker 3
You also just got about 9,000 gold. Because I sold the robe.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 3
The robe that may or may not have had a heart inside of it. At one point in time.

Speaker 2
Do I have my... monies?

Speaker 3
This is the burlap sack of heart. What do you got in a sack, boy? Don't worry about it, son. Why is he moving?

Speaker 2
Well, yeah, I got plenty. I can buy that.

Speaker 3
I got a jugger. He just shoved it into a jar. Just to add insult to injury,

Speaker 5
he just shoved it into a jar. Really? Honest to God, what would actually be hilarious is to shove it into freaking, like, broken bottles. Just smash up a bunch of bottles,

Speaker 1
throw it in there,

Speaker 5
and then just walk around shaking it.

Speaker 3
I want a sack full of broken glass that I'm going to put this heart into. Why do you want to do that? Don't worry about it. Why are you asking questions? I've got a sack of glass. I've got a sack of glass. Shake and bake, and I helped.

Speaker 2
Oh, wow.

Speaker 3
Okay, so everyone does their shopping Yeah I'm buying a very expensive shield

Speaker 5
Very expensive shield

Speaker 1
Can you use it too heavy? That's why it's expensive Animated is plus two bonus Yeah, that would be $49,000 for a plus five Heavy steel shield that's animated

Speaker 5
What does animated mean?

Speaker 1
I let go of it, it floats around me for four rounds and then I have to do it again later. Does it count as being? It counts as working. Does it count as being equipped with exploding? Yes. Unfortunately it's a move action to do it.

Speaker 5
Nevermind then.

Speaker 1
Well, it defends in a...

Speaker 5
No, no, no, nevermind then. I can't use shields. That's armor.

Speaker 1
Oh, my, my, my. It shears the same space, even if they move, okay. Still takes any penalties associated with it. Yeah. And non-proficiency. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Today is...

Speaker 1
Okay. Cool. Yeah. Today you go to hell, perhaps. So, yeah. I could not afford the rod. But, you know, it meant I got another plus 7 AC. Because, you know, I was falling behind on that. I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker 2
Has it got a plus 5? How many charges does our rod have?

Speaker 1
Three times a day.

Speaker 2
And made it?

Speaker 1
Yes. So plus seven shield? Yes. Wow. So yeah, that was 49,000 gold.

Speaker 3
Like I said before, the economics is ridiculous.

Speaker 1
It is. It is. And I bought and I replaced, the other thing I wanted to do was get a difference at a full plate that has all the same things but is plus five instead of plus four.

Speaker 2
Our delivery is up. It's up to delivery right now. They're just on the road.

Speaker 1
I was able to calculate the difference. So what are we doing then?

Speaker 4
How are we getting...

Speaker 5
98% chance? Yeah, you got it. I'm just going to get... Before we do this, I'm going to go piss off Lothar and have him tell me to go to hell and be like... Bam! And then I disappear.

Speaker 1
Pull out a hand desk.

Speaker 4
And there's just a note falling to the floor. It just says mission accomplished.

Speaker 5
Wish granted. Wish granted. Which is crazy. God damn it!

Speaker 3
You just specifically go to Lothar to piss him off. So are you all going to the captain of the guard right now? No, I'm not going to do it. I really want to. Because I do have to be together when he casts the gate spell. Yeah. You're like, peace out! And never leaves but Luthor. And you're supposed to stand there awkwardly with his middle fingers up. It just reminds me of the... I'll just leave myself. I gotta go.

Speaker 1
So if we... Okay, so we're ready to go to hell. Is there any reason not to go straight to that tower?

Speaker 5
I can honestly say. Don't know. That's fair. That's fair. I don't know.

Speaker 1
I don't know of any.

Speaker 5
I only know of one other person who's been to hell. and they never came back. Yeah, that. I made the point that we broke the other lock, so we had an easy way to get there if you weren't around. We had a way to get there. But then I realized we actually broke the other lock. So we don't have an easy way to get there.

Speaker 1
One thing we might want to buy that won't use up money unless we use it is Gem of True Resurrection. So we need a heavy duty gem for material component. But the good news is we don't use it up unless we cast the spell. Because it's still valuable.

Speaker 5
Heavy duty gem.

Speaker 1
Yeah, the resurrection spell needs a diamond worth 10,000 gold. Do you want to buy and just hold on to it? Because that won't actually spend money until we use it.

Speaker 3
Give me a minute. Onions are back.

Speaker 5
Oh my God, I can smell it. I should have gotten red. So, they smell, but they're not overly smelly when you're used to it. It opens up, you smell it. But like I said, the moment you leave the area and you come back, It's like getting hit with a frickin' onion. Yeah. The onion noodle. Yeah, I can... You can hold on to one of those. I can have a...

Speaker 1
Cool. I can have diamond.

Speaker 4
Cool. Super diamond. I hate the way some of the books show, like, damage. Example, I'm looking at Heavenly Fire. says 1d4 points of damage plus one for every two sorcerer levels there is no comma in that statement at all so to my brain that would say that 1d4 plus one is is the whole thing so at a level 17 that would be uh what is it 8 7d6 plus 7 you know but according to everything that i'm reading out there everybody interprets it as it's 1d4 comma plus one for every you know plus one for every two levels what level spells it the heavenly fire yeah it's a bloodline trait oh so yeah like i said there's no comma in this sentence so 1d4 plus one for every two sorcerer levels so i were to put a in there and said 1d4 comma plus 1 for every two levels see where i'm going with that one d4 plus one per two levels so i would think that it would be 76 you know plus seven but according to everybody

Speaker 3
else on the alliance unfortunately it's it's a level one sorcerer so it's going to be the weakest version. Hmm? What's this? Sorcerer blood blood.

Speaker 4
I'm annoyed how they word damage in some of the text. It's called

Speaker 1
Heavenly Fire?

Speaker 4
Yeah. And like I said it says 1d4 plus 1 for every two cast for every two sorcerer levels. So to me that would be if I'm level 17 that would be 8. D4. D4 plus No, no, no. Yeah, it's absolute trash. There should be a comma in there, right? It should be 1d4, comma, plus 1 for every two caster levels.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I see what you mean. The good news is you can also use it to heal people. No, yeah. But it doesn't heal much.

Speaker 4
I know, but my point is the wording just is totally trash.

Speaker 1
And what's funny is it doesn't even help most of the party. It doesn't help half the party.

Speaker 4
No.

Speaker 1
I mean good news is you got some resistances built in and you got the fly ability built in. So at 9th level you can fly for minutes per level per day. Oh. Poor guy.

Speaker 2
Did they make him do the deliveries? That's just mean.

Speaker 1
You remember the conviction ability, right?

Speaker 4
What?

Speaker 2
He shows up.

Speaker 4
Conviction?

Speaker 2
Yes, your 15th level ability. He barely got out of the car. I mean he's like going like this. He banged his head on the roof of his car. Gets out. He's actually got a lame foot. So he's trying to shuffle across with a freaking walker. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Why do you hire a delivery guy? I went out to meet him at the end of the driveway because I didn't want him walking up. If he slipped and fell, I'm that screwed.

Speaker 5
That's the opposite of so fast you freak.

Speaker 1
I don't see how I get conviction. You're the source, you're this bloodline right? Celestial?

Speaker 4
That's an added on that I get as an Eldritch Feast. So Eldritch got me the Celestial bloodline in addition to my dragon. So I only got Heavenly Fire.

Speaker 1
Okay, I was gonna say, yeah, conviction's great.

Speaker 4
Yeah, don't get me wrong, yeah, but Eldritch was...

Speaker 1
Oh, so you are a dragon bloodline, never mind. I'll stop trying to confuse you.

Speaker 4
No, no, Eldritch, yeah, I took an Eldritch Heritage which allowed me to get a second bloodline. Oh cool. But it starts... yeah, I don't think they have any fire from it.

Speaker 1
Okay, yeah, the rest of them are actually good, but you know what? That's okay. The dragon bloodline is also fantastic. So yeah, um...

Speaker 3
Alright, you guys finally finished your shopping and ready to go to hell?

Speaker 1
Yep. So, I will pull out the handbasket and expand it into a portal to hell. Okay. Specifically to the base of the tower. To where? The base of the tower that we saw him trapped at.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 4
Alright, so we're going to hell.

Speaker 3
Go! And you all jump through? Yep. Simultaneously with a freeze frame at the peak of your drum? Yeah. Some 80's music plays? As you, in fact it is, freeze frame that plays. Freeze frame!

Speaker 5
- Please pray. - I'm gonna be, so until further notice, I'm gonna be holding my breath. Oh my God. I've got 15 hours of holding my breath.

Speaker 2
- Is it the sulfur smell you have? - I don't know. I've never been to hell.

Speaker 3
- You actually have. You, amongst, both you two, have been. - Most of us have. - Were you? Yeah, I thought Walter went to hell. No, well he did, but he didn't come back. No, I meant Walter when you guys went down. No, no, we... No, I was...

Speaker 1
Oh, that was hell? Yeah.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, we were all here.

Speaker 1
Oh, that ain't so bad. You guys went to the law offices of Dewey Scrum and Hell. All right. I was here for that.

Speaker 4
I was here. Yeah, the law office.

Speaker 1
Well, hello, Doctor. You were here tonight?

Speaker 4
Yeah, I was. I honestly thought so. I remember us sitting in some waiting room.

Speaker 3
Yeah, I didn't realize we were in the... I honestly got... I didn't realize... Yeah, that was in Diss, the second layer of hell. Yeah, I didn't know that. You went to the law. When you met the contract devil.

Speaker 5
Yeah, sure. Oh, wait, that was before me.

Speaker 4
I remember us going somewhere else where we were talking to somebody about contracts.

Speaker 5
Well, hello there, Kitty. This is when we found out about the... The Chellis contract. Yeah.

Speaker 4
Yeah, that was definitely before me. But I remember us being somewhere at one point where we were in front of a contract.

Speaker 1
We had the contract negotiations, the cheating negotiations.

Speaker 5
It didn't dawn on Luther that we actually went to hell. I thought we just went to his office.

Speaker 3
The pit of fire in the middle of the office didn't give it away? He's a demon.

Speaker 2
What if you put him in a hole? That's right.

Speaker 3
That's right, you went to the demon offices.

Speaker 2
He was just calling him, trying to keep warm.

Speaker 3
You went to the law offices of demon hell.

Speaker 2
Heaters aren't regulated by their maintenance, guys. It's fine.

Speaker 3
Do we screw him in half?

Speaker 1
Yeah, bet.

Speaker 3
the lobs it's a dewy screwing out

Speaker 1
I mean that's not completely inaccurate

Speaker 3
it's probably a good way to put it you arrive atop an uprisen platform of flesh and bone ringed by an array of thin glass-like heat with a slippery ramp of tendrils and cartilage leading down toward the fitted top of one of Kena's countless monoliths. Immense ribs protrude from the brim of this region, looming over the players like extended talons. The ramp leads down to the entrance of the tower that extends upward as far as the eye can see. Its walls a tangle of skulls and ribs and femurs and more, all fused together to form a mind-boggling tower of bone. This structure serves one purpose: to torment... Mr. Thrun. Structure serves one purpose: to torment Brizali Thrun and all those who died for his cause. Okay. They don't like him.

Speaker 1
Or that's part of the contract. I'm sorry. Okay. Hello, cat. That was my leg. Now it's his leg.

Speaker 3
constant shrieks of pains and hollow voices from Murthy issue of elf from cages dangling from the chains of each one holding a doomed soul although the platform atop the peaches have arrived appears grisly and monstrous it poses

Speaker 4
I hate that when they intermix

Speaker 3
it poses no danger to them. Damn it! The edges of the right no reeling and character fall, blah, blah, blah. Don't fall. Definitely don't fall.

Speaker 5
Oh my God, don't fall. So, oh my God. In the words that he used, we did not teleport to the bottom of the tower. We teleported to the top of the tower. We did?

Speaker 3
Nope. Nope. We did the base.

Speaker 1
Nope. You find yourselves... That's okay. We can get airwalk. Which for you isn't walking. And we all can fly.

Speaker 3
Theoretically. A single step of stairs rise up from the interior of the bone tower. The entrance is along a winding spine-shaped curvature of a walkway that leads to the Grand Tower. Okay. And... Poop! In a puff of brimstone and the sound effect of BAMF, a pit fiend stands before you.

Speaker 1
Greetings.

Speaker 4
Well met. And we have the ability to speak in tongues. Well, what did you really expect me to say? BAMF! Greetings! Well met.

Speaker 2
Yo, dude.

Speaker 4
Listen, we got nothing to get to.

Speaker 2
That's my homie.

Speaker 4
We're here on purpose. You're here on purpose.

Speaker 3
Okay, I guess I'm going to skip that portion. He flashes a toothy grin and bows deeply. My lord Mestopolis bids you welcome to his home, Silver Ravens. I am his humble servant, Orgothan, and I have been tasked with greeting you and informing you of a few matters of protocol during your stay in El.

Speaker 2
Okay. You just stay here?

Speaker 3
Well, we're here for now. Yes. Forever.

Speaker 2
Not.

Speaker 3
Um. You have earned your right to be here, Silver Ravens. Lord Mistopolis knows you seek to destroy his pawn. Brasali Thrun, and he shall aid you in this endeavor only by allowing you to make the attempt. Your quarry lies at the peak of the Tower of Bone and indicates the large tower behind him. Yet your mortal lives are not long enough to scale the walls or fly to its roof. You must traverse the chambers within, but know the Tower of Bone exists as a direct result of Brasali's torments. It is of him as surely as it was built for him. The tortures it inflicts upon him are fueled by the agonies within these walls All of the damned who failed him in life reside within Just as he who served Lord Mistopolis and the Prince of Darkness resides above There are three rules you must abide by during your stay First, you must not venture beyond the Tower of Bones Those who fare beyond its domain into the greater wilds of Kana do so without Lord Mistopoli's promise of non-intervention. Second, you are not to release any of the truly damned souls who lie within. They serve their fates in agony here for their failures to Brasali Thrun in life. You may add to their torments if you wish, but do not attempt to risk them from their punishments. And finally, do not attempt to bypass the trials that await you within the Tower of Bone. There are roots within to what you seek, and the wise among you will find ways to weaken your foe by using his own failings against him. He grins again and bows low, sweeping towards the Grand Tower. The Tower of Bone and your old friend, Brizali, await. And for the right price, a gift to you that was gifted from one of your enemies, I will answer any questions you may have.

Speaker 4
I do want to make one comment. That's like going into a bank and they have a little sign, if you'd like to add to our existing wealth, just add more money here. Or you can just come in and do your business as normal, you know? Like, oh, I'd like to add to your shared wealth of banking. Thank you. Alright, so do we have any questions for them? So we can't fly up there, he said? Yes, that is verboten. Sounds like a challenge accepted type of deal.

Speaker 1
His comment was, our motor lives aren't long enough. We gotta go through all the things, and hey, I'm okay with weakening him, because, you know, if we can figure out ways to do so, can you tell us anything about Brazali?

Speaker 3
You have not paid the price, I will answer no questions.

Speaker 2
But he didn't tell us the price.

Speaker 5
You did tell us the price. What was it? Something that was given to us by a mortal enemy. Oh. Do you have a mortal enemy? Yeah, we do. - Enemies?

Speaker 1
- Me? - Yes. - We will, 'cause we'll. - I think we'll. - We will. - Give him a little. - Give me nothing. - Okay, I will give him the... We were given a thing from Brzali. - A while ago.

Speaker 2
Is that the um, for my time?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Um, wait. Then it went to Ben. Max didn't get it then. It was given by the city then. No, the only person who has stuff from then would be you. Yeah.

Speaker 3
Yeah.

Speaker 1
That's not entirely true. Wait. I thought. Because he, Brasali threw and rewarded us in book two? Um.

Speaker 4
We had a visit from the cousin or the something that was the messenger when we were making plans to meet. What did he give us? I don't think he gave us anything. I think he gave us, but I can welcome him.

Speaker 1
I'm not sure what else would qualify. Well, the enemies of Brasali Throne, which unfortunately there's not a lot, there's not a few that aren't enemies of Brasali Throne, But what they gave us is kind of hard to categorize, I think. Um, I reach into my pocket, pull out.

Speaker 5
I was like, I got teeth. And you just start pulling out teeth. I got, well, this is a teeth from this. This is a teeth from a dragon. This is teeth from this. This is a teeth from this. Mortal enemies that I have fought and taken trophies from. These are things that they gave me. Make a sense motive. You can do that.

Speaker 3
With a 2, I'm going to a 30. He is not bemused by your teeth of pulling. He actually seems irritated and annoyed.

Speaker 1
We're trying to figure out what on earth would qualify.

Speaker 3
29. Sense motive. Yes. No, you got the same vibe. Okay.

Speaker 1
The things that were given to us by mortal enemies, is that what you asked for?

Speaker 3
A gift to me that was a gift to you from an enemy.

Speaker 1
Oh, what was a gift to me from an enemy? I'm trying to think if there's anything.

Speaker 3
I can think of at least three.

Speaker 1
Good, because I can't.

Speaker 3
Though, one is likely not in your possession anymore.

Speaker 1
What do we have that is still gifts from enemies? You have the... was it an emulter manifest at one point? Did it get improved or replaced?

Speaker 5
I'm still wearing it. Oh, okay. It's been up to, I mean it's been.

Speaker 3
I'm going to make a wisdom or intelligence check. Let's see if we can get those brain juices going. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 1
Nat 20.

Speaker 3
Nice. Nat 20. Nope. No wisdom.

Speaker 1
Same here.

Speaker 3
All right, so you remember that the negotiator offered you each an emerald, whether you kept that or not. You remember, since you've been here longest, that the Emerald from the Negotiator, you also remember Captain Segeyta gave you something. You also remember that most recently, Yizma got some prayer beads from Narissa.

Speaker 4
I also got a cloak of resistance taken after the bridge, that bridge thing, one of the first sessions. It was from Rufus? He'd never offered you a gift. Actually, I... This is only a gift, not something you take. Nope, it's a gift.

Speaker 5
The captain didn't, it never registered that he's in... So far we never had to fight him, so it never registered me that he is my enemy. The question is what did he give you?

Speaker 1
He gave us the cup.

Speaker 5
The teacup that we smashed into five pieces. I've got several pieces. We've only used one. So four? Oh, we've used two. Three? We have three more. Yeah, definitely. I totally... I always assumed... Honest to God, I always assumed him as a friend.

Speaker 3
As an ally? Well, not an ally, but not really an enemy. The naval officer of Jellix you assumed was your ally?

Speaker 1
Not... Let me phrase that.

Speaker 5
not an enemy. Because it'd be really interesting now because if you come back now it'd be like, alright I'm gonna blow your boat up then?

Speaker 3
I mean Except because of the Contargo contract. He can't bring his ship back.

Speaker 1
And the thing is he was never in a position where we actually were in an antagonistic relationship with him. Correct.

Speaker 3
Oh sure you were. Antagonistic by definition.

Speaker 1
Well, no, but what I mean is he was always relatively cordial, and we were not in a place where we could or actually wanted to fight him.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I suppose that still defines him as a mortal enemy, though, just because we weren't combatants at the time.

Speaker 1
Well, you're not wrong. He is our enemy by...

Speaker 3
Will's Flynn and the Lin didn't give you anything. What's that? I was trying to think if Will could be any buttons. I don't think he had to qualify. No, those were taken. I couldn't remember if I gave you any buttons.

Speaker 4
Hands from the master, unwillingly given.

Speaker 3
Bump for wealth. Slaps a sticker on you. That would be great if that's what would have worked on this. Yeah, that would have been amazing.

Speaker 1
But I don't think we spent the emeralds.

Speaker 3
I do not.

Speaker 5
Mine are sitting on my freaking... You don't spend much money. I didn't, and it's an emerald. It was cool.

Speaker 3
So you pull out a piece of a teacup? I'll actually pull out all three pieces that I have left. And offer it? Yeah. And he takes it and he looks at them and he's like, "Hmm." Very well. Questions you may ask. I'm going to give him a hundred bucks kind of... Very well. Go ahead and ask your questions.

Speaker 1
That's better.

Speaker 3
That's more pit fiend voice.

Speaker 1
I found it more pit fiendy. You were asking him. The first question was, what are the biggest feelings of Brazali's food? That's what I'm thinking we should ask.

Speaker 5
I think part of that is finding out what is being a food.

Speaker 1
Yes, but what I'm saying is if we know what to look for. His overconfidence? I mean, you're not wrong. But I figured that might be a valuable question to ask. So what were the biggest feelings of Brasali through?

Speaker 2
Keeping his heart. The biggest feelings was keeping his heart.

Speaker 3
Yep, you got him.

Speaker 2
Being a good guy.

Speaker 3
The feelings of Brasali will be revealed within the Tower of Bones. Well, that's not...

Speaker 1
It's going to be like a montage.

Speaker 2
Montage!

Speaker 1
Gotta have a montage! Well, I figured if he was answering questions, they would actually be useful answers. Because, I mean, yes, they'd be revealed, but you know.

Speaker 5
But he also said, a lot of this is to teach us as we're going through the test, which we're not allowed to skip.

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. But knowing what to look out for would have been helpful.

Speaker 2
But yeah. I can tell you this much. I was not good at school. This is going to be bad.

Speaker 3
Aren't you the most intelligent character in this party? Yes.

Speaker 1
Doesn't mean I test well. Hey, I have you know I have a solid 10 intelligence.

Speaker 5
I am. I am not the most intelligent, but I got wisdom up to Wazoo.

Speaker 1
Yeah, me too. Got a solid 25 there.

Speaker 5
That's a rare place to keep your wisdom. I wasn't very smart.

Speaker 3
I was very smart, so I shoved it in my Wazoo.

Speaker 2
My highest stats are almost, except for dexterity, are in my intelligence and wisdom. Yeah, that's right. We'll see how that goes.

Speaker 1
Is there anything we should know going into the tower?

Speaker 3
Great question. There are many things you should know.

Speaker 2
Great. Tell us about them.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I'll grab out a quill. And? You're contractually obligated to answer now. I have answered.

Speaker 3
You're not asking specific enough questions

Speaker 1
that we need to read off the sheet that we don't do.

Speaker 3
There may or may not be at least nine questions that you could ask that I could definitively answer. Yes, and I will try and answer whatever other ones you have.

Speaker 2
So my first question would be, what are the answers to all the questions that you should ask?

Speaker 1
I mean, that's kind of the problem. They love doing that sort of thing in pre-published adventures, but knowing where those...

Speaker 3
The first question you could ask is how have you earned the right to be here? And I can tell you definitively... Not through your wit or intelligence. By opposing the fool through and so well at so many turns, and with such success, you have wrested your land from its rightful ruler. You stand mighty and tall above your kind of heroes. Lord Mustafeles may not be your ally, but he respects your accomplishments. And in fact, all you have done to date has been according to his hopes and plans. Message.

Speaker 5
That's awesome. His entire plan was to make a deal and screw him over. Yeah, of course it was.

Speaker 1
He's a devil.

Speaker 5
I know. But still.

Speaker 1
I mean, but that does track it.

Speaker 3
I know of at least six others, now that I actually counted, that will give you very straightforward answers, and not improvised answers, but also I'll improvise some answers. as these specific questions or questions similar to these

Speaker 1
specific questions. Yeah, I get where they're going with that, but however that assumes we think like the creator of the module. We know

Speaker 2
we don't. I got a question. What's the best items that we can have that will help us through the quest with the least amount of successes. Successes.

Speaker 3
A strong will and determination. But they're not physical. And the drive to vanquish your foe. Okay.

Speaker 2
Great. Nothing holy. It doesn't say anything about holy stuff. Ew, gross.

Speaker 1
He really hates my ex.

Speaker 3
I guarantee he just hates.

Speaker 5
I'm actually not a lawful, so he's good.

Speaker 3
Yeah, no, I've definitely been eyeing these two much more than you two.

Speaker 1
I'm lucky lawful. It's just my ex hates his type.

Speaker 2
Man, my honor is holy.

Speaker 3
Celestial Arbor? You want to hear my version of the song and you cast blasphemy on it?

Speaker 1
Yeah, the problem with that spell is it doesn't work well for our party. Any of the versions of it.

Speaker 2
I'm trying to write my own song. My own spell here.

Speaker 1
Yeah, the problem is if I used Holy Word it would screw over half the party. Was, um... Your paladar lawful neutral? I believe it was Waffle Neutral. Yeah, that's kind of the problem I run into is none of the alignment base spells are actually good for the party to use. Because we have chaotic goods, we have Waffle Neutrals. And that's actually half and half on the party. Pretty much. Because you and I are Waffle Neutral, and those two are chaotic good.

Speaker 3
Which covers everything but... You could ask, perhaps, how I knew that you were the Silver Ravens.

Speaker 2
It doesn't have anything to do with the things that are on our outfits, would it?

Speaker 3
Honest to God. You have things on your outfits?

Speaker 2
Well, he does.

Speaker 3
Honestly. I don't think he does. No. But I'll tell you why, because I'll keep this ball rolling. That doesn't mean anything here. I have slain enough of your silly band before to recognize your particular brand of indignant outrage by smell.

Speaker 2
You're not silly. Did you kill Walter?

Speaker 3
Who?

Speaker 1
Tom Salt. Nope. No, he died in the ninth level of hell.

Speaker 5
My favorite is... You must be a Belmont. You must be a Belmont. Bell Mots Only a Dolmots would come in Backhand Dracula

Speaker 3
Yeah that's right He just punched it and squirted in the jaw And he's like you must be a Bell Mots He doesn't even He doesn't even You must be a Bell Mots

Speaker 5
That's right That's where I feel that this happened Only of this stupidity would do this. We have made sure the legend of the Silver Raven raises stupidity every generation. There's a level of stupidity that is branded by Silver Raven. Turns out we're just the answer to an equation that they put in place.

Speaker 1
Just everything is proceeding as I have first seen. Exactly.

Speaker 3
You must be a film.

Speaker 1
He must be a raven. Right. I really don't know what questions they're expecting us to ask, really. Because he's not really giving us anything helpful for the tower specifically.

Speaker 5
Well, we don't need anything helpful for the tower because we're going to go through. It's a journey of self-discovery, or any discovery. We're not to release any souls.

Speaker 1
We're supposed to do the trials.

Speaker 5
And we have to go through it.

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 5
That's what I got. There's a third one, but I... Oh, don't leave the tower.

Speaker 1
Don't leave the area.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 1
Which is fair. I'm glad we need this plane shift.

Speaker 4
Yeah. So we don't have problems with cheating. Like, we can cheat through these trials, right? Well, we have to do the trials honestly, but that doesn't mean we can't... Oh, listen, you're a devil. You don't have any...

Speaker 3
And you can find a proper loophole, perhaps.

Speaker 1
That's what we mean. Proper loopholes. Are there proper loopholes? Are there problems? Yes, sir.

Speaker 5
Or did you... I don't understand.

Speaker 1
So, if we make ourselves immortal, then flying is allowed, but only... Because it's a mortal life that would be the problem, but the problem is that would take too long.

Speaker 5
Actually, I think it's just you're mortal, and you try to fly and you're going to get killed. Could be. We can see the top. Yeah. Oh, I thought we could.

Speaker 3
No, you can't. I saw the top. We saw the top. You saw the top. You know that there is a top. There is a top. You saw it from the font of visions. Yeah.

Speaker 1
But. We have no idea how far up it is. I just made the assumption that if there's a top of a tower, there's definitely a bottom of a tower. Seems logical. Which is why I went to the bottom of the tower. Which is... I wonder what would have happened if we actually tried to go to the top of the tower. Well, she might have just said no. Which is a valid... The owner of the plane can say that. Gate. Okay. She might have redirected it to the bottom. She? The head of the plane? I thought that was a she. You're in Cana. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3
Miss Mustafelis is the rule of Cana.

Speaker 1
I'm sorry.

Speaker 3
We're in the least lower of hell. There's no she's.

Speaker 1
Hey, you're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I missed that class. And every other one like it.

Speaker 3
I have average intelligence.

Speaker 1
I have average intelligence? It had zero knowledge to play. I know them words. I read goodly. That is about right for this character. They have yet to actually study any... Any knowledge whatsoever. Do you have any other questions you can think of? Can I ask? I don't. Going blind is the raven way. That is true.

Speaker 3
That is... That is... True. Going in blind is the way of the raven.

Speaker 1
I wish I could say it otherwise, but it ain't. It's how we've been doing things all along.

Speaker 5
Hey, it's worked so far. So far? So good. Mess with it now.

Speaker 4
17 levels in and that can't be bad luck. That's not bad luck. It's not just luck.

Speaker 1
It's not just luck.

Speaker 4
It's three characters later. It's a very merciful DM. One of the two.

Speaker 1
Merciful, DM, and three characters later.

Speaker 3
To be fair, you sent one home. One volunteered to leave. Yeah, I didn't have anything to do with that character's death.

Speaker 1
Nope, nope. He, on the other hand, did cause some other character to retire. Forever retirement.

Speaker 3
That is true. He did cause the death of a character. Not on purpose.

Speaker 1
It never is. That's a mean.

Speaker 3
Yeah, just like, I almost said Wilk didn't mean to go to hell, but it's not Wilk. Walter Morley. Walter didn't mean to go to hell either, but things happen.

Speaker 1
And that was the only artifact we ever found, I think. That's a trap. No, no, the artifact that I had with me. The Book of Many Spells.

Speaker 3
Oh, you had that?

Speaker 1
Yes. I thought Bill had that. No, no, that's how Walter was trying to escape. he went through every page of the book and not a single one I thought Bill had the book of infinite spells nope nope nope that was Walter he went through every page hoping for something to help him get above the situation cause he was he was good enough to cheat on those spells with his knowledge with his magic device however not a single one

Speaker 3
There's only six pages left in the book.

Speaker 1
Yeah, that was the problem. And none of the six were relevant.

Speaker 5
That was like from book three.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Which is why I had it, because it was one of those, hey, this could get all sorts of useful things. Nope. Nope. Nope. Dimensional door. Dimensional door does not get you home. Nope. And he was looking to find a mundane way home. Could not find something. Could have made a deal. He could have made a deal. He's deciding, no, I'll kill myself instead. Because that way he goes back to his home with his deity Malani. Yeah. Because he was a good rebel. So yeah, that. Anyways, life must go on. So, let's enter the tower. Let's go through the tower.

Speaker 5
Thank the pit bean for his... Help. Help.

Speaker 1
yeah

Speaker 3
since you gave me such a fine gift i'll give you this question how can we weaken brazali's by using his own failings against him would have been a great question to ask yeah yeah despite its immense size there are about nine floors within the Tower of Bone, the ninth being the roof where Brasali's truon is chained. You must navigate the other eight via portals linked to the mortal flaws, and you mortals have so many of them. Yet these eight flaws are the greatest of Brasali's life. By studying the emotions and memories trapped within these portals, you may be able to deduce the nature of the perils you might face in the areas beyond. Then as you pass through these portals, his flaws will assault you, trying to weaken you. Make them your own. Take them into yourself, and in so doing you will erode his soul and weaken him. But know that taking too many of these faults into one will cripple you. No one person should shoulder all the failings of such a titan of mortals. Okay.

Speaker 1
That was actually the first question I asked. What do we need to know?

Speaker 3
The first question is, what are the failings?

Speaker 1
Oh, that might be the second question then. But yeah, I thought I asked what do we need to...

Speaker 3
There was a huge tangent after that question.

Speaker 5
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong. We did not ask how to use the laws.

Speaker 1
No, I thought I asked what do we need to know, but yeah.

Speaker 5
And he said many things.

Speaker 3
Anyways. Thank you. Any final questions that might have sparked from my answers?

Speaker 1
How do we know when we're approaching the limit of what one person can handle?

Speaker 3
It is personal. One mortal may handle more than others, but taking all failings onto oneself will surely cripple the soul.

Speaker 1
Okay. I mean that's what they're intended for is to cripple Mr. Throom.

Speaker 3
But if you take them upon yourself, they...

Speaker 1
Too many will be a problem.

Speaker 3
Yes.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
Yes.

Speaker 1
So realistically from a game perspective you're making a check for each one and as soon as you fail you're...

Speaker 3
Realistically you're gonna take penalties and one character taking all penalties would probably kill that character. Fair enough. It's may or may not meant to spread out amongst a party.

Speaker 1
I'm assuming that there's going to be penalties to each stat, more or less. No, no. I'm just... they're failings. They are failings. And he did call them applause. Mm-hmm. So yeah, well, let us enter the tower. I'm assuming there's a door.

Speaker 3
Yes, there's a pathway that leads to the large staircase over there. Okay. Well, I will lead the way in. I will make an intelligence or wisdom check, because I want this question to be asked. Intelligence or wisdom? 11. 11?

Speaker 1
Yeah, I think I'm right here. I rolled the net 20 plus 7 last time. 12. 12.

Speaker 3
16? All right. he mentioned that there was a number of prisoners in the tower and that you can't release his specific words were deserving you can't release any of the truly damn you can't release them can we make their

Speaker 1
lives better no well you can add to their torment he did say yeah so giving giving them some hope could be considered theoretically adding to the torment oh good point or what's 16 intelligence or

Speaker 3
Intelligence. Okay, so your brain starts thinking like Volodar does, and you're like, I wonder if, he said specifically the damned souls can't be released. But the undamned souls. But does that mean...

Speaker 2
There's undamed?

Speaker 3
Is that your question?

Speaker 2
No, I'm thinking that in my head. There's undamed?

Speaker 1
So there's definitely people that failed him.

Speaker 2
Right.

Speaker 1
But theoretically there could be people who didn't fail him who also got roped in because devils.

Speaker 2
Right, other types of prisoners who were just tossed in for the ambience. Right. Sorry.

Speaker 4
Do you think someone will appear to us to be thrown even though they're not? And then therefore we are violating this part of the agreement?

Speaker 2
Would I know the difference?

Speaker 1
How can we tell those who are truly damned in the tower?

Speaker 3
The tower is full of the damned. Those who failed, Brazali, Thrun. Right. Everyone roll a sense motive.

Speaker 4
We can't get him.

Speaker 1
Huh. 15. 15. 15. 15.

Speaker 2
15 myself, actually. 15.

Speaker 1
No, he's the, um.

Speaker 2
This is the one with the plus 28 or something. Because he's thrown, in which case I get two more points.

Speaker 3
Roll another dice and then 48. Uh, 48. 48? Okay, so y'all are like, hmm, the way he said it, it's weird. And Luther just looks up and is like, yeah, he's trying to hide another question. He's trying to hide the fact that there might not all be damned souls in there.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean, we kind of assumed that. We were asking him how you could tell which ones are damned. And he didn't answer. He answered briefly.

Speaker 3
And Luther's sitting there like, yeah, he's holding back information, guys, as he reads his newspaper. Because that's the pantomime I just did. Yeah.

Speaker 1
So, is he going to... Might as well ask, how do we actually determine those that are damned?

Speaker 3
There is almost only damned souls in the tower.

Speaker 1
I hear that. But how about the ones that aren't... No.

Speaker 2
Are there any un-damned souls in that tower? You have to answer. Are there any un-damned souls in that tower? Yes or no?

Speaker 3
Yes, there are some un-damned souls in that tower.

Speaker 2
So we are allowed to rescue them?

Speaker 3
Yes. Yes, you're technically allowed to rescue those ones. Okay. And he says this, like, literally, like, biting his tongue, biting his finger, as he tries to answer.

Speaker 1
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 3
He's technically answering, whether you understand his muffled voice or not. And then, like, Dobby, he beats himself in the head.

Speaker 2
You bet, Dobby! I'm gonna iron my fingers!

Speaker 1
There are un-damned souls in the tower. But he's unwilling to tell us how to release them or how to tell them apart.

Speaker 3
You'll recognize... oh is that a question? You kind of said it as a statement.

Speaker 1
Well I asked him specifically how to tell and he didn't answer before. He said they're almost all damned in there. Yeah. But that wasn't how I said how to tell them apart.

Speaker 3
Are you able to recognize those who are not deserving of their fate?

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
We will be able to recognize him Okay

Speaker 3
Yeah

Speaker 1
Oh wait

Speaker 3
Was that a statement or a question?

Speaker 1
That was a statement But Shit Never mind that in my part But he did say We will be able to recognize him

Speaker 3
Yes

Speaker 1
Which means he had

Speaker 3
No that's not a statement Damn it I'm the worst devil

Speaker 5
So, the way to say it is To clarify You did say Just repeat what you said

Speaker 3
With a question What I just said with a question

Speaker 1
He's making a high assumption of us Which, if that's false Means he's lying

Speaker 3
The ravens cannot figure out which ones are damned and which ones are not damned.

Speaker 5
I'm assuming the ones that aren't damned will probably be people we recognize. That's a valid thought. Or they'll be like having glowing halos around them in hell. Yeah, which, you know, that we could recognize.

Speaker 3
Where we'll just... There are specifically two un-damned souls in the tower.

Speaker 1
Are there people we've met before?

Speaker 3
Tell me your entire life story and I'll let you know.

Speaker 1
Specifically, there were two people we know of that got their souls devoured or whatnot. There was the...

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, no, that sister, her soul is gone. It doesn't exist.

Speaker 1
Kind of thought so, but yeah. Yeah, that kind of... That would be the sort of thing that might have been...

Speaker 3
Those house wasps ate the living shit out of that soul. Yeah.

Speaker 5
Yeah. So really? Wait, so house wasps... Eat souls. Yeah.

Speaker 3
Can devour the soul. Yeah. Huh. That's terrifying to think about. It is.

Speaker 1
Both their swarm and they devour souls. Yeah, that's fair. Terrifying is a valid... So, and Vrizali's the one who set that up?

Speaker 5
He did, of course.

Speaker 3
Oh, I'm going to have to meet up with him again. I think it was the high priest of Asmodeus that was the one who captured her and kept her inside the temple. I'm sure he's in here.

Speaker 5
I'm pretty positive he's in here.

Speaker 1
I don't think he qualifies as an undammed soul, though. Oh, no, no.

Speaker 5
He qualifies as the He's going to qualify as the Extra We're allowed to give extra

Speaker 1
I have a holy symbol too I have a holy symbol right Hey Do we still have that thing From the old high priest of Aradon Yes He might like that The thing that makes him completely powerless

Speaker 5
And cursed

Speaker 1
Yeah that Seems like we're allowed to give him things like that. As long as they don't help him. The one that gives me... Yeah, I know, but... It doesn't do us any good, but completely takes away the power of a priest. It would be the sort of thing that would be helpful here.

Speaker 5
He's like chained up in hell.

Speaker 1
Uh-huh. I mean, fair. He's already powerless. Is he now an outsider?

Speaker 5
Must be just a soul.

Speaker 1
Are the souls here outsiders now?

Speaker 3
No, they've been judged and belong here.

Speaker 1
No, that's what I mean. So they are native to this point now.

Speaker 3
They are now natives of Hell after being judged.

Speaker 1
Oh, so they won't like my axe.

Speaker 3
I don't know. Can I see it? You can see it easily.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
I'm just gonna have him throw it over the cliff if you handed it over. Uh, no, no. Can I see it?

Speaker 1
You see with your eyes! Oh, I need it! Yeah, it's the evil outsider Bane Axe.

Speaker 3
No, I mean they're native outsiders.

Speaker 1
Yes.

Speaker 3
They're not outsiders. You're outsiders.

Speaker 1
We're outsiders here, but they're outsiders to the axe, are they not? I mean...

Speaker 3
Evil outsider Bane. Yes, they would be evil outsiders. Yes, they would be evil outsiders.

Speaker 2
I can't think about it. To you.

Speaker 5
No, because he's speaking from the identity of this place. Because we are the outsiders.

Speaker 3
You are the outsiders, but you are not. It would have to be a mortal Bane weapon for you. because you don't actually have alignment based on your plane of existence. It's complicated.

Speaker 1
There's a reason why the sword of the planes exists. Sure. That's the one that the further away you are from the material plane the more powerful sword it is or something like that. Sure. This is back to the planescape level of weirdness. Alright. Let's go in the door.

Speaker 2
It's a racing time, guys.

Speaker 1
Yeah, let's go in the tower.

Speaker 3
Alright, so you head down the staircase. Or down the pathway towards the staircases.

Speaker 1
Yeah, let's look for traps. We don't want to get sent home or something.

Speaker 3
I see trap. Yeah, you wouldn't want to get sent to hell or anything. Banishment. Every door you open is a banishment spell. Dang it, I'm back at home. Whoa. Home plane. Home plane.

Speaker 5
Some of you are not dropped in a volcano. I learned this. If I was dropped in water, I'll just hold my head and you don't.

Speaker 1
Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, presumably the banishment spell, while it's random, it doesn't instantly put you somewhere specifically deadly. You may not be able to live there long. It's a percentile. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3
Leave it to the percentiles to figure out your fate.

Speaker 2
Gentiles? What?

Speaker 3
The gentiles. We'll figure it out.

Speaker 1
So is that why I have the fork for the positive energy plane too? I guess. So when I plane ship people there, they kind of just explode?

Speaker 3
You regenerate so hard, you die.

Speaker 1
Well, and if you send undead there...

Speaker 3
Well, yeah, undead would explode. Well, living people do too. Yeah, because you regenerate so hard, you die.

Speaker 1
You regenerate so hard, you die.

Speaker 3
Yes. So you send down the... It's why it's an insta-kill touch. Anyways. And in the tower, as you approach the large staircases, you enter the tower, and there are six gargantuan statues of Brizali Thrun, each facing the main hall of the area.

Speaker 1
Okay, so just a weird question. How does the Aura site work here in this plane?

Speaker 3
Oh, you guys got super headaches.

Speaker 1
And he has the Arcane site going. Yeah, you guys have...

Speaker 4
I have blindsense now, so... Yeah, I have blinds.

Speaker 3
Yeah, you guys both have headaches. This place is kind of overwhelming your senses. Well, I suppose your tru-site goggles are also giving you interesting questions. No, actually, everything is actually real. Tru-site? Yeah, tru-site. It's not seeing through any of the...

Speaker 5
As long as I don't activate the...

Speaker 3
Actually, that pit fiend that showed up to you, Luthor, it looked like Wilk Wimbledon in a little puppet thing. Like in Labyrinth. A little puppet guy inside the giant suit of armor.

Speaker 2
Wilk Wimbledon is answering your questions as best he can!

Speaker 3
No, it's not. It was definitely a pit fiend.

Speaker 2
I knew it! I knew it was bad the whole time!

Speaker 3
You'll be sorry! This is what you get for panting me in public! The whole time it was Will Quimbley. Mistopolis isn't even in this campaign. Will Quimbley. He's Mistopolis. Has Mistopolis. About 70 feet beyond the entranceway there's a Single hallway that leads to a whirling purple flame.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 5
What are the statues made of?

Speaker 3
Just stone? Bone and sinew.

Speaker 1
That sounds... Disgusting. Yeah, traditional. Traditional. Oh, good. This actually doesn't overwhelm me at all. It's only when they're, um, it doesn't, because I'm not, um, I'm not opposed to the alignment directly. This is a very strong lawful alignment, a very strong evil alignment. Correct?

Speaker 3
Yes. Yeah, the, everything.

Speaker 1
Neither, neither one is opposed to my alignment directly.

Speaker 3
It still is overwhelming, though. It's just very powerful. You haven't seen auras like this since the Academy.

Speaker 5
Uh-huh. The Academy.

Speaker 1
Okay. But yeah, it's basically if I concentrate on detect evil for three realms. That's what I'm seeing here.

Speaker 3
Yeah. You detected a lot of law and a lot of evil. The most powerful aura is everything.

Speaker 1
But I'm assuming things are more specific. The air itself is, I'm sure, has an aura.

Speaker 3
Yeah, that pit fiend was more flaring.

Speaker 1
Well, his aura is probably about the same power as mine.

Speaker 3
Nope. Nope. He's a good thing.

Speaker 1
I thought outsiders and clerics had the same aura level.

Speaker 3
If they're the same level.

Speaker 1
Well, I thought we're in the same band.

Speaker 3
You feel like your aura is weaker than his.

Speaker 1
Oh, of course it is. But what I'm saying is I thought once you start talking high level caster versus high level devil, they're roughly the same

Speaker 3
not you okay his aura was stronger

Speaker 1
oh yeah he's a piffy

Speaker 3
evil well in law it's much stronger than yours in evil

Speaker 1
oh yeah my aura is all law

Speaker 3
no evil but you were you were not far off but you feel like he has a stronger aura

Speaker 1
oh yeah although I will say greeting him with greetings probably

Speaker 3
bam Bam. Greetings. Well met. Okay, I guess I'm going to skip that part and go right to the conversation. What was he supposed to say? I'm not here to fight you or something? No, he tests your strength. If you don't have a... If you give him the chance to, he tests your strength.

Speaker 1
Fights you for a bit or something? He fights you for three rounds. Oh.

Speaker 3
Blasting off three quicken fireballs during those three rounds.

Speaker 1
That's nice one.

Speaker 3
On top of all the other stuff that he does. Speaking of which. And then he starts trying to talk to you after that. He's like, "Ah, you seem to have proven yourself." But you immediately greeted him, so I'm like,

Speaker 5
"Well, I guess we're going to skip the fight part." That was a good thing.

Speaker 1
So yeah, speaking of which, I am going to do communal resist energy on fire. Just to give us all some fire resistance. Less fire than normal. Seems like a useful... Going into the purple... I thought of something we should give you to. Dispel magic. That's a good one. So yeah. Very good one. don't know actually i don't know that that would work because it's not us it's the spells that we have on us that are targeted i don't you'd have to be the judge of that one it's like it's like

Speaker 2
putting out a barrier of like oil so it can't doesn't spell meaning to just give you like sr

Speaker 3
infinity yes yes so it'd have to be a spell that has sr to it well and basically everything does Yeah, but I don't know if Dispel Magic has SR. If there's an SR check.

Speaker 1
No, it does not.

Speaker 3
No SR? No SR. Okay, then it wouldn't work on Dispel Magic.

Speaker 1
Well, good thing to check. Yeah.

Speaker 3
Fair question.

Speaker 1
That's funny. Siphon Magic. What do you do? I Dispel your Magic and take it. Yoink. Mine.

Speaker 3
There's a large purple glowing ball of flame ahead of you. And six statues of Brazali through them.

Speaker 1
Does this look like a portal? Or something else? Yeah, it looks pretty

Speaker 3
hell portal-y. Well, I think we gotta go through it. Alright. Alright, so you all approached the portal. Let's give a marching order. I'm in the lead. You got point.

Speaker 2
That was make somebody go through first. Make sure that nobody dies before I go. I'll go second.

Speaker 3
Second.

Speaker 4
I'm squishy, so.

Speaker 2
Third.

Speaker 4
Yeah, third.

Speaker 2
I'll take up the rear.

Speaker 3
Okay. One, two, three, four.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 3
Does anyone willingly take on the faults of this portal?

Speaker 1
Do we have any indication of what the fault is? Nope. Good!

Speaker 2
So I said somebody else won't get first.

Speaker 3
It doesn't matter if it's your first. Any one of you can take it. I guess I'm taking it?

Speaker 2
You're first.

Speaker 1
Alright. How much did I screw myself?

Speaker 5
Well, we'll find out. First portal. How many do we have to go through? Eight.

Speaker 3
Take 18 points, sorry, take 9 points of fire damage and 9 points of unholy damage. Okay. And you receive a minus 2 on all fortitude saves. Okay. Everyone else make a "Fortitude" save.

Speaker 2
Fortitude... 22.

Speaker 5
27.

Speaker 3
A measly 19. A measly 19. Why doesn't it give me

Speaker 5
the DC...

Speaker 3
Why describe the DC... Why describe what happens there and give me the DC two pages later? 19? 21? 22? 21? 22 and 20 something? 28. 8? You two take four points of fire damage and four points of unholy damage. So no fire damage. And you take nine points of fire damage

Speaker 1
and nine points of unholy damage.

Speaker 4
How much of the unholy, I'm sorry?

Speaker 1
Nine of each. So the fire damage is minus 30, so...

Speaker 3
And as you absorb this flaw into your being, the tower rumbles and shakes a little bit. And you hear from what seems like impossible distance a shout of pain.

Speaker 2
Oh, good. Hold on.

Speaker 3
And...

Speaker 2
Hold on, I have a question. I also have my blazing robe on, the cloak. They don't stay. Which is fire resistance. They don't stay. They don't stay. Okay.

Speaker 5
So I need to ask. You're not taking the fire damage, you're taking the unholy damage.

Speaker 1
Okay. Yeah, everyone's taking 30 off any fire damage we take. Okay.

Speaker 3
For done. And you all see a vision of Rizali as a young child giggling with delight as he vis-a-sex a weasel in front of a crying girl who looks like she may as well be his younger sister.

Speaker 1
That sounds par for his course.

Speaker 3
You have absorbed the... Oh, I'm going to make a note of this just in case. Pen, pen, pen. Markers, you absorb the law of cruelty. Oh.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
That one's going to Max.

Speaker 2
Is it a good weasel?

Speaker 3
Yeah, you vivisex a weasel in front of his whole sister.

Speaker 1
Well, I mean, he vivisexed souls later, so this tracks.

Speaker 3
And that leads you to this chamber, which is described thusly. So the waviness of the flames dissipates as you finally travel through this portal. And you find yourself walls made of compass fused bones stretch up all over a hundred feet to a vaulted ceiling in a cathedral-like space. A dais at one end rises up to a stage-like area where walls are fitted with three flame-filled archways. on the eastern side. You are on the western side. Should I pull the map up?

Speaker 1
Sure. Do you have a page? Player view grid, map takes off. I'm looking at the we did all that stuff. Ribway?

Speaker 3
Yeah, the ribway is where you joined. But that whole page is actually all the maps that will make.

Speaker 1
Okay, so Hall of Penitence?

Speaker 3
Yep. Okay. Hall of Penitence.

Speaker 1
Map came off. I don't want to know. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's such a tiny map.

Speaker 3
A fourth burning oshway sits on the opposite wall where you guys entered from.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
Torture implements range from iron maidens to stretching racks to chairs fastened with spikes lie strewn haphazardly throughout the hall, While the walls contain five layers of 10-foot square alcoves, separated from the room itself by lengthy barbed iron bars, forming twin banks of cells from which there seems to be no method of entry or exit. The wall is a tangle of razor-sharp bones jetting upward at odd angles. chamber um this is a this whole tower is a scale of one to ten so we'll double one second here let me just start because of course they didn't want to give me a five foot square tower it's also absolutely tiny yeah okay so yeah because it contains a lot of your map on this one page yes

Speaker 1
that. As I'm sure you see. Yes that's what I'm looking at right now. Let me go back here and

Speaker 3
import the picture. Also there are two devils in case that description was bypassed.

Speaker 1
Okay. You got a slight problem here. Here's the map. Oh, boy. I'm fixing it. Scale of one to...

Speaker 4
Are those ten-foot sections or five-foot?

Speaker 1
Ten.

Speaker 4
Okay.

Speaker 1
Or at least closer. I can actually do it correctly here. Grid scaling is such first point.

Speaker 4
Did we bring hero with us or were we just by ourselves?

Speaker 5
We did not bring hero with us. We didn't say we were bringing hero with us. Which to say, hey...

Speaker 3
That's at least closer. You guys might recognize these demons. Because you fought some of these demons before. Okay, so we just ended up here? Yep, that's the portal you came through.

Speaker 1
Okay. So I'm assuming we're just going to go over the grid.

Speaker 3
Uh, this is the grid...

Speaker 1
It's the right scale, just not...

Speaker 3
Yeah.

Speaker 1
Put this guy there. Yeah, I'll have to tell it just...

Speaker 2
Oh, it's your friend's.

Speaker 1
And that guy over on the other table.

Speaker 3
Okay. Oh, close. Middle tables. This guy and that guy. Okay. There are two souls on these wrecks. Okay. One each being entertained by the demons present. Yes, the demons. But you guys might recognize them because you were all at the bridge incident. These guys seem like roided up versions of what Rufus brought with him during the bridge incident. They have six spider-like legs that come down to a torso, humanoid-ish torso. Oh, sorry, four. No, they have six legs. This image is wrong.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
their head and faces is like glowing ember okay um

Speaker 2
knowledge planes would you know be useful here knowledge planes what you need roll

Speaker 3
not a problem i'm assuming initiative yeah and uh everyone rolled initiative as they both turn over you and ruin. I rolled good for initiative. It's weird. So did they. Oh, maybe you're not being sarcastic. 12 on knowledge planes. 12? They're definitely demons. Definitely demons.

Speaker 2
23 on knowledge planes.

Speaker 3
23? Yep. Wormonger devils. They're known for their group tactics and coordination. Okay. Military coordination. Okay. Going around the table for initiatives. 16.

Speaker 2
29.

Speaker 3
Ridiculously high.

Speaker 2
I rolled a 20. I'm like, great.

Speaker 3
Sorry. 6. 6. Wow, we got a winner. 19. 19. I'm sorry. 7. 7. Okay, well that doesn't change anything. I'm well aware Lyanna where's your marker so these demons are currently entertaining the two souls on those rack tables in front of them and they both turn to you and go oh no sorry you don't think they're demons they are devils in fact they both turn to you slowly as you come through the portal like mid cuts and they go mmm

Speaker 2
Do I know their special... Their...

Speaker 1
Any weaknesses or...

Speaker 2
Yeah. Immunities? Huh?

Speaker 3
22. Like all devils, they are immune to fire and poison. Like most devils, they resist acid and cold. Like most devils, they resist spells. And like most devils, they resist physical attacks that aren't of the good alignment. So you want electricity on your boat? These ones in particular also don't seem to have any particular relative. Oh, um, they coordinate militarily quite well and get even more bonuses when working together. than the average bear.

Speaker 2
All right, you just flip these guys up. Yep.

Speaker 1
Well, I mean, you can make all your arrows have electric bursts just for the fun of it because you're an arcane archer type.

Speaker 2
Let's work that wad of... That rod of...

Speaker 1
Quickening?

Speaker 2
Quickening right away and haste everybody. Cool.

Speaker 1
We're all hasty. Great.

Speaker 2
Might as well do it now. Okay, and then I shoot.

Speaker 3
Okay. How long does haste last? Is it minutes or rounds? Rounds per level.

Speaker 1
So, you know, like 15 rounds. So, it'll be this room. Maybe the next. Probably not. Depending on... Probably not the next room.

Speaker 3
Like a minute and a half, that's what we're talking about. A little bit more than a minute and a half.

Speaker 2
Evil?

Speaker 3
Yes, like all devils, they're evil. Like all devils, they're evil.

Speaker 2
Hey, I'm making sure I add my four, okay? What the damn four?

Speaker 3
I want the damn four. What are they susceptible to?

Speaker 5
Electricity.

Speaker 4
Electricity.

Speaker 5
Well, electricity is the only thing they don't resist. They're not susceptible to it. And anything good aligned.

Speaker 4
Oh. Yay, have me fired.

Speaker 3
Are you taking A or B?

Speaker 2
Um, that guy. Casey side? Casey side or Matt side? Casey side because I have a closer clearance to that one.

Speaker 5
It's just a hair closer so. Are we back to these being five foot squares or ten foot squares? These are five foot squares. Okay. That's what I was asking.

Speaker 3
You had the 19. Yes. I have to ask that because that's unusual. It is very unusual. I rolled the 18 on the die. Which is why I'm like, wait a minute, who had the 19? I got to get these guys in order. Yes, I rolled the 18 on the die, so. Ah, that explains it. I was reading the numbers, I'm like, 19? Who got a 19? 6, that must be, oh wait, no, 6 was Luther.

Speaker 1
Who got a 19?

Speaker 3
Not Luther.

Speaker 5
Not Luther. No, I do not understand how Luther never goes first.

Speaker 1
Well, I mean, it's one thing if you build a character for an initiative, which... But he is a dex.

Speaker 5
You have a lot more dex than I have. I have a decent amount of dex that...

Speaker 1
I mean, I rolled a 1 and got a 7. Yeah. But... Well, yeah.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
No, you're not Bill's character who has plus 16 to initiative. Okay.

Speaker 2
Does 46 hit?

Speaker 1
Yes. Good.

Speaker 2
43. Yes. 28. No. 32. No. Okay, sorry. Three arrows hitting. And the first one hit twice. Yes, that's what I mean. So, I've got three arrows hitting, so it's... Don't forget, plus one for haste.

Speaker 1
Oh, plus one on the attack? Plus one on the attack and plus one arrow.

Speaker 2
Plus one arrow push.

Speaker 1
Plus one attack.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
F away's attack push, yes. Is everybody hasted?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay. Not that does you a whole hell of a good point.

Speaker 3
No, not everybody's hasted. We didn't haste them. It only hastes allies.

Speaker 2
Okay, so then the question is, does 33 hit?

Speaker 3
No.

Speaker 2
Okay, so then the first... There's three that actually hit anyways, right?

Speaker 1
Yep, so four total.

Speaker 2
Four total. Got it.

Speaker 3
Well, you need to roll your extra attack. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Well that one's not going to hit anyway, so fine.

Speaker 1
I'll take your best base tech force, so that's not impossible.

Speaker 2
No, I rolled an 8. So even with all the added stuff, it's not going to hit. Okay. Because the 9 didn't, and if that's the case, even if I had to... Well no, the 9 was an interrobotap. It would have had 13. But at that time... So that's the question. My added attacks are 25, 25, 2015.

Speaker 3
8 plus 25. It doesn't hit.

Speaker 2
It would be 8 plus 25. It would be 8 plus 1 for the haze, plus 4 for the evil outsider.

Speaker 1
Plus 25.

Speaker 2
So 38. So... This is why I do it in here. I can just do it out here. So hold on This is why it takes me a minute to do stuff So that would be a 38

Speaker 3
Yeah that would be

Speaker 2
Okay so then 38

Speaker 1
Max you're on deck Max isn't doing anything exciting Max is releasing his shield and getting big Yeah

Speaker 2
whole but he did okay so i'm going to be doing electrical damage as well do you want that separate

Speaker 3
or add it in uh electrical damage you can add it together okay what kind of weapon do you have

Speaker 2
it's uh uh i don't have anything written on it i just gotta look it up It's not in here. That's what I mean.

Speaker 1
Okay. So yeah, I cast Divine Power.

Speaker 2
Plus three, Adaptive Evil, Outsider, Bane, Composite, One Vault. Okay. That's where I was. Alright. So. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I have Divine Power Cast on myself now.

Speaker 2
So total damage would be 119.

Speaker 1
119?

Speaker 2
Damn.

Speaker 1
They've been kissed. Unfortunately you didn't crit on that at all. Otherwise that would have been really fun. Cause that would have been 3/10 extra damage or 2/10 extra damage. And guess what? You became Plum Academy number 1.

Speaker 2
Yay! Oh it's fun and it's their turn.

Speaker 3
I don't have anything special. Nope, they don't have anything special like that. I can't do anything like that.

Speaker 1
No, I just made myself bigger so they get to meet my axe as they approach.

Speaker 2
*laughs*

Speaker 1
Red range. Probably yes. I don't know if yes. They might not be a yes. Where is the last speed? Of an unlaid swall. Of an unlaid swall.

Speaker 2
African or European? No!

Speaker 3
Oh, there it is. Oh, that is less impressive than I thought it would be. Like 30 feet? Well, it's more impressive than what you thought it would be. But for a quadruped

Speaker 1
You would think they'd have more Unfortunately I used both a move And a standard action So at best I could have done this

Speaker 2
You're the target Because I can't get past you

Speaker 1
That is kind of the side effect of the spell But the good news They can't really flank me Normally speaking Okay I'll hit him

Speaker 3
Oh

Speaker 1
They have reach as well.

Speaker 3
They are also large creatures. But they have to charge you. Snooker is their AC by 2.

Speaker 1
They have to be one closer. Oh, sorry. 10 feet of you. That one's fine. The other one wasn't.

Speaker 3
They both had to charge you because they don't have enough movement to move and attack you. I'm okay with this. So they both charge plus 2, minus 2.

Speaker 1
And they're only attacking once probably hopefully.

Speaker 3
Yeah, because they have a move action.

Speaker 1
Oh, a charge action, yeah. Unless they have pounce, which I won't put it past them to give that sort of thing. What's your AC? 42. Because I have a shield now.

Speaker 3
So the first one. Moves up and hits you for... Do that. Take 23 points of damage. Okay. And the second one... He hits his will. Hits his will. Actually, he hits you real hard.

Speaker 1
How on earth did... What does AC do anymore? I mean, I have plus five full plate, and I have a plus five shield. And he critted you. Of course he did.

Speaker 3
Take 48 points of damage

Speaker 1
from the second hit. Okay, 45 it is. Okay, I'm under half.

Speaker 3
That one got you right in the ribs. That second try it in.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I suppose the question is what do I do for AC? Because I have maxed out gear for AC.

Speaker 3
Yeah. I just barely hit you, by the way.

Speaker 1
Good, because there's literally nothing... Don't get hit by crates. Yeah. There's literally nothing more I can do for AC in the game.

Speaker 3
Yeah. That first one was right on the money.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
And that was a hard thought to get there.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 5
But on the upside, they moved into range.

Speaker 1
They did move into range. And you can miss flanking.

Speaker 5
Oh, yeah. Yes, because I couldn't hit them before they moved. So I would end up sitting and holding my wrist. All right.

Speaker 4
We're going to do heavenly fire on this guy right here. Is that an injured guy?

Speaker 3
Yeah. All right. Is that a touch attack or a normal attack? Range touch. All right. Touch attack. They're touch. Oh, he's going to get hit.

Speaker 4
Range touch. would be an 11.

Speaker 3
Are you sure about that? Can't be that low. Dex, right? Dex plus your BAB, which is half your level.

Speaker 1
Plus your point blank shot, I hope. I don't have a point blank shot. You don't have point blank precise? No. You're using range touch attacks, though.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Usually they're not. I don't know when you touch them.

Speaker 4
Okay, so additional... you said half the base tech bonus? Yeah, half your level is your base tech bonus. Wait, sorry?

Speaker 3
Half your level is your BAB. So your BAB plus your dex.

Speaker 4
Oh, got it. Okay, so that's an additional 8. So, 19?

Speaker 3
Yeah, that touches. I had to ask because 11 did not. I'm like, oh, you're going to definitely touch one.

Speaker 1
Why are you using that spell?

Speaker 4
Because it's gonna... It's nothing... It's gonna hit him.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Can't you choose? Is that what you're worried about?

Speaker 4
No, it just doesn't do anything. It doesn't do much. Nine points of damage to him. It's, uh... I just thought you'd have something more powerful at this point. Oh, I do. I just wanted to start out and try something I haven't tried before. Okay. Nine points of damage. It's, uh, divine.

Speaker 3
Divine. It doesn't get reduced. Who's Luther? I wanted to guarantee it. So there is... The one who crited you is the one who's wounded.

Speaker 5
Oh, good. Okay, so the one who's not wounded is the one I'm going to attack. Jumping around there. And you don't provoke Dex of Opportunity? I will to get there.

Speaker 3
So you'll provoke once?

Speaker 5
I will provoke once. But I will, uh, I'm going to frickin' Dex. What's your AC? I'm going to, uh, tumble to get into there.

Speaker 3
Oh, okay. Uh, versus your CMD, which is...

Speaker 2
Where's your CMD? Oh, that sucks a lot.

Speaker 3
So, the next video... I hate when they put it so low on the page that it's on both pages. Where's your damn CMD?

Speaker 5
Is it higher than 40?

Speaker 3
I would hope not. CMD higher than what? 40? 40 exactly? No.

Speaker 5
More than 40? 46.

Speaker 3
Yeah. I spent a lot of time. 40 exactly? No. I didn't reveal anything. What are you talking about? You're dumb. No, your face. That's good because I would have criticaled you on that one. Dick. Yeah, this die does not like you guys. I see that. That's two crits out of three. Maybe I should change my 20 because I don't want to have TPK on the very first floor of the tower. does a 33 hit? 33 does not. Are you flanking? He is flanking. I am flanking. 33 does with flanking. Oh, good. Really? Yes. Oh, that is every single hit, isn't it?

Speaker 5
No. One of them is not going to hit. Okay. My last attack only because it's a plus 13.

Speaker 3
What kind of attack are you doing? Holy.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 3
That's all I need.

Speaker 5
Holy.

Speaker 3
That's I have a T.

Speaker 5
Yachty.

Speaker 3
yada yada. Um, any elemental damage? Um, not right now. Alright, then give it all in one big old go. You're only hitting the one target? Yes. Or are you spreading it out? Nope. Okay. I'm gonna make sure. Alright, give me one big old total and uh, Liana. Yep. Top of the round again.

Speaker 1
Um, seems like it just happened. That means we're going quickly. I didn't

Speaker 3
attack a single time. That's true. He enlarged himself and became a big old target.

Speaker 2
mm-hmm what do I feel like a target yeah so that one on this side is still the same one it hasn't moved right yes it came closer but uh still on that side yes the one that you hit originally is

Speaker 3
still on Casey's side as opposed to Matt's side yeah I guess I could say your side instead of Matt's too, on the same side of the table. But Casey's closer. Yeah. Okay. Alright. The other one is being punched a lot. Just a second to roll and we'll see where we're at. The secret number is 35 as Luther just discovered.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
In case you're... So you don't have to keep asking. 35 is the number. Well...

Speaker 1
Flanking is beautiful.

Speaker 3
Yeah. 33 did not hit, but flanking gave him that hit. That's why I said 35 is...

Speaker 4
I'm going to do arcane cannon and I just needed a little mark.

Speaker 1
You told me about this spell. One spell I saw for Arcane that's hilarious is Decapitate. When you take someone who critical and you make the critical extra modifier bigger and do some extra damage.

Speaker 4
Nice. What was it called?

Speaker 1
Decapitate. Decapitation. I think it is. The problem is it needs someone doing a slashing attack.

Speaker 3
Yeah, someone has the critical with the slashing attack.

Speaker 1
Yes, and then you just cast it and it does a bunch of damage and it multiple helps the crit modifier.

Speaker 3
Do you have to write it? Is it an immediate action? It has to be an immediate action. Yeah, it's an immediate action.

Speaker 1
So the thing is, it's a 6th level spell, you just kind of, "Oh, someone did something awesome!" Someone did something much better. Well, I have that on my arcanist, because one of our people is a paladin with a greatsword. Ah. How would you like the greatsword to crit on at times 3? And the other person is a slayer with a Dorvan Lorax.

Speaker 2
Nice. How would you like that to be at times 4? What's the magic number?

Speaker 1
35.

Speaker 2
So I've got four arrows that hit this time.

Speaker 3
Cool. Oh, my torso.

Speaker 2
Do you have a holy weapon, by the way? It's a...

Speaker 1
Yes. Yes, yes. It's holy outside, evil outside. It's evil outsider being, but I wasn't sure if it was holy. So yeah, you should be getting four dice, six dice for each arrow, too, for the evil outsider being holy, and then the d6 for the cold. Right, right, right. So five dice, six extra per arrow.

Speaker 2
I can see why that might The bonus hero didn't hit either Just so you're all aware I did growth where it's not it

Speaker 1
Max you're on deck Oh I have to see if anyone survives I have four attacks But I have to see if anyone survives

Speaker 3
I'm just letting you know you're on deck They have a whole bunch of math That they have to get through before

Speaker 1
Yeah and each hit does 5 die 6 plus 31

Speaker 3
for me. Oh, for you.

Speaker 1
Because plus 31. Why not? Okay. So, attack 1, attack 2, attack 3, and attack 4. Okay, so attack one hits.

Speaker 2
129.

Speaker 1
129 on V.

Speaker 3
Block.

Speaker 2
He died?

Speaker 3
He died.

Speaker 1
So two hits for sure.

Speaker 3
And you're flanking.

Speaker 5
I'm pretty sure I didn't kill it.

Speaker 3
I don't know. You hit it like six or seven times, didn't you? Four hits. I got four hits. I hit it seven times. Seven times? Yeah. I mean, you might.

Speaker 1
Well, if he doesn't, I will finish it.

Speaker 3
Yeah, especially if you hit it. I hit it four times. Four times? F-words? Yeah. Minimum damage. 200. Six. And six. You didn't kill him. I finished him. I didn't think so because... I'm just letting you know. 200, six, you didn't kill him.

Speaker 1
And I hit him four times with 31 damage added on each hit. Boop.

Speaker 3
Boop.

Speaker 1
So, yeah, that'll do it.

Speaker 3
Yeah, that did it. Rocket tag much. I was just wondering if you were, like, winding up the swing or if you actually had to follow through or not. You did have to follow through. I did follow through. And, yes. Probably that first hit. I still hit him all four times. Maybe the second hit.

Speaker 1
I still hit him all four times.

Speaker 3
Yeah, I'm just saying, you probably might go one hit. If not, maybe. I mean, definitely by the second hit. 17. Most likely with the first hit. 20.

Speaker 1
22 plus.

Speaker 3
22? Yeah, with the first hit.

Speaker 1
22 plus 31.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah, you took him out with the first hit.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Needless to say, this axe is sharp.

Speaker 3
I rolled a nat 20 on your, when you were moving into position, by the way. Whoa.

Speaker 5
Yeah. That could have sucked.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Then I rolled a 13 to confirm, which would have given me probably enough to confirm. Against you. Against you. Against you, though. Okay. So? There are two souls on those two middle racks there. Okay. And there are numerous souls in each of the cages. Okay. Do any of them have any good auras? None. None of them have any evil auras, though. Okay. Not on this floor. Do we recognize any of them? The ones on the rack, or are you going cage by cage? I'm going to look at the ones on the rack first. Yeah. You do recognize one. There's a half-orc on the table on Matt's side. Okay. A half-orc that nearly killed your Luth- Walther, I believe. Okay. He was a, uh, berserker.

Speaker 1
Oh, was he from the Order of the Ravens?

Speaker 3
Or the- No. Uh- No, he wasn't one of the, um, Bandle Hawk.

Speaker 5
He was, uh, he was in the, he was in the, uh, When we were chasing down the skin cult. Okay. They set fire to the red room area. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1
So I wasn't there for that one. Walter was. Oh, he was, okay.

Speaker 3
Yeah, it was during Walter's time.

Speaker 1
Okay. Well?

Speaker 3
He was slain in the Temple of Asmodeus. Okay. Your first encounter of his then was during Walter's time.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
I believe mid-temple you switch due to circumstances beyond your control. Yes. So I don't remember if Walter was there for the final blow or if Max was there.

Speaker 1
Well, not very many people survived writing to Walter.

Speaker 3
True, but he did the first time, so...

Speaker 1
No, he must have not been nearby.

Speaker 4
You know, we should have asked before we left the guard, the guy at the entry, if there was some distinguishing physical marks.

Speaker 1
We did ask if there was any more.

Speaker 5
They said we'll know if they're not supposed to be here.

Speaker 3
A will save. Max. Okay. That's so too bad.

Speaker 4
You'll know.

Speaker 3
I failed. Like I said, it'll be right. You have a very strong compulsion to turn that rack at least once. I do. Yeah. Okay, I do. Okay. Walter goes up to the rack and starts cranking it, and the soul starts screaming in pain. Wait.

Speaker 1
What? Walter is gone.

Speaker 3
Yeah, you're talking about him, right? Max went up to the rack and turned... Well, when I roll, Will saves like this. Is that in that one? Yeah. Yes, when that happens. And you kind of find a little bit of delight as the creature screams out. It's doing! You're like, this is...

Speaker 2
I like this. Make it off!

Speaker 4
Yeah, I cringe.

Speaker 1
We had permission to...

Speaker 4
Not cool.

Speaker 5
We have permission to increase their suffering.

Speaker 2
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.

Speaker 1
It seemed like a good idea at the time. He tried to kill me.

Speaker 4
A lot of people tried to kill you.

Speaker 2
He sat here and tortured them all. We'd be here all day. Let's just go.

Speaker 1
You're right. I didn't say that. Let's look our way down the cubby. Yeah, we want names and backgrounds for each one.

Speaker 3
You don't recognize any other people on the cells. And everybody looks as if they're supposed to be there. I'm just going to walk up and ask you a term. Are you supposed to be here? Are you supposed to be here? No, of course not. Maybe a second we'll see.

Speaker 5
That would be it. Sure. Like you ask every guy in jail if he's not supposed to be there.

Speaker 3
27? No, 29. That impulse is like, you know what would be fun? Turning that crank. But I got a job to do. And you resist the urge this time.

Speaker 5
Turn your neck crank.

Speaker 4
One more twist. Just one more twist would have been pretty fun. I'll come up in the center and I'll just yell out, like, looking for anybody that's not supposed to be here. You know if you're supposed to be here.

Speaker 3
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I am. I'm not. Yes, I am.

Speaker 4
Oh! Bird is in that damn ravens in one of those things.

Speaker 3
Damn it, Gilbert. I don't even remember his name.

Speaker 4
I sense motive I'm going to sense motive on all of them so you know you don't know if you want me to roll or just average it

Speaker 3
um you feel like they're telling the truth that they don't belong here because you believe that what they believe is what they're telling they're not lying they don't

Speaker 5
they don't they don't believe they belong here they don't believe they belong here except that one guy he's like out for it

Speaker 4
maybe he's the one maybe he's maybe he's Neo

Speaker 5
Neo

Speaker 4
He's the one. I'm gonna go talk to that guy. Be like, "Hey, you know, just..." You're the one. You're supposed to be here, huh?

Speaker 3
Yeah, I mean, I kind of failed Brasali Perun. Okay. It sucked. I shouldn't have failed him. Okay. I deserve everything I get.

Speaker 4
Okay. He's so honest.

Speaker 3
Weird. I like that. That's the one. That's the one. Oh, Max. Yeah. Roll another. We'll save.

Speaker 1
Yes. Okay. That's like 42.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, you don't even feel the urge this time.

Speaker 1
Sense motive. I wonder if that's because I have his failing amongst me right now. What? You have the flaw of cruelty?

Speaker 4
Yeah, that. Sense motive on a 29, am I noticing his, like, his, like...

Speaker 3
29?

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Speaker 3
Yeah, you're noticing he's acting slightly abnormal. You okay? Than normal. I mean I'm feeling a little bit of an urge to torture people. I'm not sure why. Oh. Because it makes you feel good. The one time it made you feel good. Since then you're like maybe not. I'm not getting as much out of it anymore. I'm not getting as much out of it as I did the first time. The first time was great. The first time was actually kind of fun. But now it leaves a bad taste in my mouth a little bit.

Speaker 1
Yeah. So yeah. Might as well continue on guys. Before I have to make another little say. Look at that. What I was doing while I was walking around is stabbing myself with the wand of cure light wounds several times.

Speaker 3
Stabbing with the wand. There's three portals, three fires at the end of this room that look very, very familiar to the previous one we went through. So who's taking it this time, guys?

Speaker 4
I'll take it. Okay.

Speaker 1
Alright. There are three portals. Oh. That's right.

Speaker 2
Left, right or center?

Speaker 1
Is this the one with the water? Next. Uh, there are three portals, I'll let you know. No, no, no, I'm just for the map perspective.

Speaker 3
Yeah, no, that's, there are three portals.

Speaker 1
Okay. I suppose the one with the water isn't particularly...

Speaker 5
It depends on which one we take.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Do we want to take the one on the left? Cause why not? Let's just roll a dice, shall we? Sure. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. You're taking the, the take, the thing? The first, the first one's the left one.

Speaker 3
So from your perspective, the left one is which one? That one.

Speaker 4
This one?

Speaker 3
The northern side? Your right one.

Speaker 4
Our approach would make left my side. Okay. Your right.

Speaker 3
We're going to need the bathhouse.

Speaker 2
No, we do. Okay. Just write the letter that's corresponding with us for him on his hands. Oh, true. There you go. Left.

Speaker 1
And we're going to be right. Oh, there's bathhouse. C4.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, sorry, C4, the pathos.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I turned off the map tags, so... Should I tell you the letter or the title? Because neither one... You can just point at it over here. Oh, yeah, because you have them all up. I have them all up, but I turned off all the tagging. Yeah, I turned on the tag for a second there, but yeah. I'm just not putting a grid up this time.

Speaker 3
Okay, I'll point it out.

Speaker 1
Let me just create this real quick from clipboard.

Speaker 3
Anyone willingly taking a flaw?

Speaker 4
I am.

Speaker 3
Yizma! Yeah. Voluntarily taking the flaw. Do-do-do. Do-do-do-do. Do-do-do-do. Do-do-do. All right. Everyone but Yizma, I'm going to need a fortitude save.

Speaker 2
Fortitude saves.

Speaker 1
Probably. Mid-thir-

Speaker 2
Um. Thirty. I rolled a twenty.

Speaker 1
Like, mid-thirties.

Speaker 3
Yizma. I take 10 fire damage. Oh, that's easy. I need to take 10 unholy damage. Okay, well that's easy. And, what did everyone say for their fortitude size? 30 something? 30 with it, 20. 20... 39. 20, 39? 39. Everyone take 5 points of fire, 5 points of unholy. And he's mine. As you all see this vision of Brizali as a young adult being mocked and laughed at by prostitutes and friends alike as he flees a brothel with a look of shame on his face. You are sickened. Oh, that sucks. Yeah. Do you have that minus two on your fortitude save?

Speaker 1
Yeah, I just have really good saves because the last character died to saving throws.

Speaker 3
Ah yes, it's true.

Speaker 1
There we go, perfect.

Speaker 3
You come from there. Okay.

Speaker 1
Okay, I'm raising my axe defensively. Okay.

Speaker 3
Where's the description of this stupid floor?

Speaker 1
We took five...

Speaker 3
Five fire, five one hundred. Let me take the fire. Did not pass that far too. Oh, and as you absorb the... that you absorb there.

Speaker 4
You're afraid of the ladies. There's another reflection of that? That's what the second came from. Oh yeah, that's right.

Speaker 3
As soon as you finish

Speaker 4
your description, I'm going to do a heal on myself. A heal spell.

Speaker 3
Heal life?

Speaker 4
The heal scroll, so that way I can get rid of the second.

Speaker 3
Make a...

Speaker 4
Are you sure you can get rid of it? I thought that was sickened, yeah.

Speaker 1
You can get rid of sickened, but the cause... Make a spellcraft.

Speaker 4
Now you got that damn song in my head. 26.

Speaker 3
26. Heel spell will not help remove that.

Speaker 4
No?

Speaker 3
Well, you're in hell.

Speaker 4
So we just have to take it.

Speaker 3
Yeah, just take it. But again, the tower walls rattle and shake as you hear this furious voice. This might also cause him to be sickened or something.

Speaker 1
I don't know. We don't actually know. But that's my supposition.

Speaker 4
And

Speaker 1
this one goes to our

Speaker 3
favorite Yzma base character

Speaker 1
Yzma. Oh, shit. Oh shit, yeah I'm going to cast that spell before I go through the portal.

Speaker 3
The pristine walls of this room are polished smooth, solid sheets of what appears to be unbroken and unblemished ivory with no visible seams. The air is pleasantly warm and perfumed while several inviting baths filled with crystal clear water stand in a complex room, in the complex room's various wings. An alabaster statue of a beautiful woman clad in robes and holding a silver lyre stands in the center of one of the arrays of the bathing pools. The one right in front of you. Okay.

Speaker 5
Is it a woman? The statue? Yep. Yes. Oh, okay. As described.

Speaker 2
Is it a fake woman?

Speaker 5
Well, is it an illusion of something else sitting there ready to kill us? Oh, yeah, you have true seeing.

Speaker 3
Yes, it is a statue to your eyes. Okay. So it could be a goal. Thank you for reminding me though. Valid. Because I forget what everyone can see and not see.

Speaker 1
Everyone here has weird shit going on.

Speaker 3
Yeah, everyone has weird shit with their eyes except for Liana.

Speaker 1
Who needs to grab C Invisibility permanently later just for that? Just to have everything covered. Just to have all points. I have blind sense. Yeah, that works too. You have blind sense?

Speaker 4
Blind sense. Blind sense. Is that right? That's what you get at, yeah.

Speaker 1
high level dragon sorcerer the worm powers of the 20th how far range

Speaker 3
60 feet I think 60 damn

Speaker 1
it's not perfect sight

Speaker 3
it's not blind sight but blind sense yeah

Speaker 1
you know something's there which is good enough to glitter dust yeah glitter dust is a beauteous spell especially for second level even if it doesn't blind him it makes him not invisible

Speaker 3
also It gives you like a minus 20 on your stealth check. Yeah. Which is funny because Walter was still sneaky with glitter dust. Walter got hit with glitter dust and he still couldn't find the damn bastard.

Speaker 4
Because he's both invisible and has high stealth. So 60 feet, essentially, for creatures that you would normally not detect.

Speaker 1
Okay, cool.

Speaker 4
So we got it covered.

Speaker 1
So, weird. We don't see anything here that's immediately attacking us, which is unusual.

Speaker 3
I mean, it's only the second level. It might not be unusual. Maybe the first level was unusual. You're right. There's nothing currently torturing anything in this room.

Speaker 5
I'm not going to look at the water. Yeah, makes sense. Is it real water or is it acid? How are you looking at the water?

Speaker 2
Throw a coin in.

Speaker 5
I'll touch it.

Speaker 3
With your hand? You're not wise. You're like, no, no, as he dips his hand in his hand, he's like, oh, it's water.

Speaker 2
You're dumb.

Speaker 3
It's like, oh, an apple. It's very warm and pleasant. Could this be acid? It's urine. No. No.

Speaker 1
It feels like a hot tub.

Speaker 4
No, it's urine. It's when they dunk people. I'm sorry. It feels like a hot tub. That makes sense. Urine wood.

Speaker 1
I really want to be... I really want this in our base.

Speaker 5
Yeah.

Speaker 3
To the first pool? Bath house.

Speaker 5
Yeah, that was right.

Speaker 3
Right there. I wasn't sure if you had a specific one.

Speaker 2
We don't have, we have the room to do that. When was the last time you took a bath? I bathe all the time.

Speaker 3
Do you? I mean, no one's ever said, I take the time to bathe every time you guys go back to your base. So, I don't know. I assume you also haven't peed or pooped this entire camp.

Speaker 1
Right. No one's said everything, so I assume that none of this ever happened. Technically, since level five.

Speaker 5
Everyone's been constipated since level 2. My body is like in since level 5 and I've cooked the metabolism thing. I don't think I do pee or poop anymore. Mugs are fucking weird, man. I only have to eat once every three days. I can drink a teaspoon of water.

Speaker 1
It feels like a hot tub water. Okay. Well, I will come forward and Uh, test this pool. Okay. They seem like... I will use the water to get the blood off my chest from the stab wounds I just did.

Speaker 2
You did a freaking offering?

Speaker 1
What is wrong with you?

Speaker 3
Oh, he's washing the blood off of his own blood off of his wounds.

Speaker 2
I'm going to examine the statue.

Speaker 3
Okay. This will make a perception check for the statue. Perception. Perception.

Speaker 2
Perception.

Speaker 3
What's Yuzma doing? I'm going to find some perceptions.

Speaker 2
28. 28 is... Unless it's about evil outsiders, which gives it plus four. It's not an evil outsider.

Speaker 3
It's a statue. Well, it's my favorite enemy.

Speaker 2
It's got information.

Speaker 3
So you're like staring at this person like, wow, she's really, really pretty. You know who she could be? An older version of the girl we saw from the previous room.

Speaker 2
Oh, his sister. Oh, gotcha.

Speaker 3
There we go.

Speaker 2
Gotcha, gotcha.

Speaker 3
That tracks. The adult version of that little girl who watched that weasel get vivisected.

Speaker 2
Poor thing.

Speaker 1
I'm sure she has nothing but good things to say about him.

Speaker 2
Oh.

Speaker 1
Also probably dead.

Speaker 2
He probably brings off flies.

Speaker 3
Well, I mean, as a kid, he vivisected a weasel in front of his little sister, so ripping wings off flies seems pretty tame.

Speaker 1
It sounds like a step down on his...

Speaker 3
I'm actually much nicer than I used to be. Ripping the wings off the flies and turning them into walks.

Speaker 5
That's terrible. Alright, I'm going to make a lap around this. Okay. You swimming in it? You have supervision? I can see all.

Speaker 1
I can see all. But yeah, pretty much. With his goggles of true sight.

Speaker 5
If there's a hidden door. Hidden people. Invisibility, illusion, or something.

Speaker 3
Doing the whole left? Yep. Okay. Get to about here and notice something this pool. Is it alive? Um, yes. Is it a baby kraken? It's not. I like baby

Speaker 5
krakens. The pool's really small so it couldn't be a full-size kraken. That's why I'm asking. Who would like baby kraken then? I killed a baby kraken. You actually

Speaker 3
predict that in this pool it goes down about probably 30 feet holy shit um the other pools uh these two and the alcoves were the other deepest ones okay um the the ones the circular ones are like five feet so you're just like rounging them but the other two could potentially go to 15 to 20 feet okay and the middle-ish part of that pool you're guessing would be 30 feet and something's looking back up at you. Like watching you? She's been turned. Make a sense motive before we do anything else.

Speaker 5
Good call.

Speaker 1
Do you want me to align this just slightly? Or does that matter really? I don't think it will matter. Because we should be able to do this. And have things to, you know, about...

Speaker 3
I'm supposed to be right up by the statue.

Speaker 1
44.

Speaker 3
44. 44? You feel like it's watching you with confidence that you can't see it. As a matter of fact, it's not trying to hide. Gotcha. But it doesn't believe that you can see it and it's watching you intently. It's definitely not trying to hide, though. Right. So like, so, uh, I'm just going to be like looking around and like, all right. And it doesn't kind of, kind of, I don't know what, what you do when you're submerged, staying where it is. Yeah. It's not creating ripples. It's like floating. It's submerged. Yeah.

Speaker 2
But it's just like, yeah.

Speaker 3
I don't know what, what it's called when you're submerged and it's just floating.

Speaker 2
Almost like it's in stasis.

Speaker 3
Not floating, but like, right. It's just, you know. But it's not creating ripples, and it's not like an invisible creature would create ripples in the water. This thing is not doing that. All right, I back. Make, what analogies do you have? Engineering.

Speaker 4
Sorry, what did I miss? Something in the water.

Speaker 5
Possibly.

Speaker 4
Possibly, oh.

Speaker 5
Definitely. There's definitely something in the water, but it doesn't know that I know that it's there.

Speaker 3
What analogies did you say? I'm working on it. Engineering. Engineering. You don't think it's construct. Right. You don't have to roll that one.

Speaker 5
History. No. Nature. Nature. Roll of nature. It's natural. Wait, hold on. At this rate, I don't even know if it's alive. Being Luther.

Speaker 1
It's a thing.

Speaker 5
What did your total get? Nat one?

Speaker 3
Nat one. And I have five. Being Luther. There's something alive in here. This is the prettiest demon you've ever seen. It is a gorgeous looking demon. Gorgeous looking water demon. And some very, very far down in your core is like, not a demon, but it's got to be a demon. It's a demon. Very, very far down inside you. Like, every time you think demon, something inside you. You hear the all-knowing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You hear Volodar's voice saying no every time you think the word demon. But you can't think of a different word to use to describe this beautiful demon.

Speaker 5
Okay, I'm going to keep looking around like I can't see it.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 5
We're a bluff. Yeah. Yeah. 13. Okay.

Speaker 3
So you're circling the pool? Like going around?

Speaker 5
No, because the moment I see that, I don't want to... You're so dizzy. Because in order for me to try to sell it, it wouldn't work. So I'm just going to be... Once I get up there and I catch a glimpse, I'm just going to keep going like this. And then I was going to turn around and walk away. Okay. So, like, you go up there and you're like, oh, look at this totally room over here.

Speaker 3
Oh, well, this room is great. And then you start turning around. And as you're like, oh, this room, I'm totally paying attention to the room. It actually submerges a little deeper into the pool. As you feel like your bluff was not as good. as it could have been. Oh, that's... Oh, never mind. Maybe that bluff was as good as it could have been.

Speaker 5
That was one of the better bluffs I could have pulled off. Okay, never mind. I was pretty confident.

Speaker 3
You feel, since you understand how sense motive works, you feel like it's all right through your bluff.

Speaker 5
If there was a way to sense motive bluffing, that would be awesome.

Speaker 3
You do sense motive bluffs.

Speaker 5
That's what it used against you. No, I mean, to understand, using self-sense motors, to understand how to bluff people. Back in the 35 days.

Speaker 3
It's like Oliver reading a book of war and thinking that he knows how to use a battle axe. Exactly. Ah, yes. I know the core concepts of battle axery. Here, let me see yours, Max. I read a book about it. You have to walk past two portals to get to where you are.

Speaker 1
Yeah, my axe is 50 pounds. Yeah, I know. That's why I chose Volodar.

Speaker 5
So, yeah, I will back up. I'm going to turn around and walk away. You're probably small again by now. A minute and a half?

Speaker 1
No, no. This is me upcasting it. Oh, no, you're saying that. Yeah, that was haste. This is me casting things with mids per level spells because I don't want to have them run out in the... I was remembering someone was a minute and a half. And I thought it was your effect. No, I am spending very little spell slots so stuff sticks around. Got it.

Speaker 5
As Luther comes back, I'm going to come back and be like, okay, there's something in the big pool up ahead. Okay. It is a beautiful water demon.

Speaker 2
Okay. Are you sure about that? Positive.

Speaker 3
Roll. No. You actually do believe that that was what it is. So he's not actually bluffing.

Speaker 2
My ass.

Speaker 3
I don't believe so. What was his motive anyway, Diana?

Speaker 2
I'm going to blink? Okay, no problem. 31.

Speaker 3
Okay, you don't believe he's lying, but you also know that everything is a demon to Luke 3. Can I acknowledge

Speaker 2
playing so... Correct. I don't believe him. I'm gonna go look for my damn soul.

Speaker 5
I've had the ability to get knowledge planes, and I have chosen not to. Because...

Speaker 1
Hey, I got my first knowledge relation last world. Because I know. Last level. So, did you all now approach this pool? Well, at this point, most of us are at the portal area, not to the pool yet.

Speaker 3
I mean, look, I want to know if this is an accurate...

Speaker 1
That was the idea of just to...

Speaker 3
There's more portals sitting right here.

Speaker 1
Yes, there are. Okay.

Speaker 5
So we do, we honestly, it was, it's trying to hide so we don;t

Speaker 2
Not from there. I'm not getting any closer because I don't know what the hell it is. It could be a gigantic squid or something and could rip me under.

Speaker 1
He said it was a beautiful water demon.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't believe him. Well, I believe his description. You were trying to crank something on someone and I hurt them worse than they already were.

Speaker 5
Why would I not? They deserved it. They deserved it. He tried to kill me and my friends.

Speaker 2
You tried to kill many people.

Speaker 3
Luther, you see it about... It actually has risen a bit after you backed off, but it definitely hasn't surfaced.

Speaker 1
Do I see its aura? I can't see. How far away is your aura? I'm here, but I can just see... I mean, how far is your rank? It's either 60 foot indefinite, I'm not sure. Let me find out.

Speaker 3
If it's 30 feet, you wouldn't be able to see it.

Speaker 1
It's not 30 feet. 60 feet. Because Detect Evil is a 60 foot cone. 60?

Speaker 3
Yeah. Right. You're noticing a good aura coming out of there. Oh, okay. What on earth is it? I will ask aloud. A chaotic good. A chaotic aura as well.

Speaker 1
There's a chaotic good thing there. Definitely not a demon. Don't know what it is. I can't see it.

Speaker 5
Alright, I'm gonna walk up to it. I've never had a problem.

Speaker 3
When you say walk up to it, are you walking up to the pool or are you just jumping in? No, I am not jumping in. I need to know what it was that you walked up to. Just walking up to the pool.

Speaker 5
Jump in, cause it's a loophole. I'm going to... It's like, hey. Come on.

Speaker 3
Roll a diplomacy. Yeah, because I got that too. Seven. Seven. No, it's a merge deeper. Okay. You can see everything Luther is doing. I just rolled a terrible perception. He's not hiding his gestures. Luther doesn't hide what he does. 17?

Speaker 4
What are you looking at? What is that?

Speaker 3
There's a magical aura coming from this pool. What else do you have? I have blind sense so I can detect. There is a creature in the pool nearly 30 feet down. 30 feet? It's 60 feet, right? 60 feet is my distance. You'd estimate it's about 25 feet down and nearly in the middle.

Speaker 4
Can I see it?

Speaker 3
No. I just know it's down there somewhere. If you had blind sight, you'd be able to see it. But you have blind sight.

Speaker 1
Well, he can see his aura. If it has a spell.

Speaker 3
It has a magical... Evidently, it's a fluid. Yeah, there's a magical aura in his pool. And he can sense that there's a creature. What kind of magic is it? Transmutation. Transmutation. Interesting.

Speaker 1
Weird. I just saw something chaotic and good.

Speaker 3
And Leon is just standing there like Guys what do you all see Have you tried talking to it Yelling at it right Yeah he did He did walk over the pool and go Get out here Hello

Speaker 1
Is anybody down there Diplomacy She actually has that skill

Speaker 5
Not only do I have the skill I take in

Speaker 1
Yes my diplomacy Checks are at minus 38 38? 38? Oh, yeah. Can we chat for a moment?

Speaker 3
It's surfacing, and then you still can't see anything, but you can sense the living creature there. And then its head comes about here-ish, and it kind of peeks out. Now you can see the head of this creature is formed just everything above the surface, And you see a pair of eyes, like ocean blue eyes, and a pure water colored skin. Not clear, but like blue, pure. What are you doing here? Hello? Her hair is wavy like actual waves. Can you understand me?

Speaker 4
Hello? Verbal? Verbal, verbal? Verbal, verbal. Is this in common? Yeah, it's in common. No answer.

Speaker 2
All right. Let me give it a whirl.

Speaker 1
I mean, it's not harming us. I will cast the tech or comprehend languages on myself. Here's what I mean. You can see. No, just so if she's seeing anything or I would understand it. Got it.

Speaker 2
Well, I can try Elven Celestial, Draconic, Infernal, Druidic. Any of those?

Speaker 3
You have Druidic?

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 3
How do you have Druidic?

Speaker 2
I took it as one of my extras when I was going through.

Speaker 3
You can have Delirida, because it's a secret language.

Speaker 2
I don't know. I want to put that.

Speaker 3
Unless you have a Libel and Druid. Oh, that's just not. No, that is a language you're not going to have.

Speaker 2
Fine.

Speaker 3
You should also have Silversign. That I do.

Speaker 2
Now she knows how to do it.

Speaker 3
Sorry, say those again slower.

Speaker 2
Elvin, Celestial, Draconic, Infernal.

Speaker 3
Okay. Well, you can try Celestial.

Speaker 1
We've tried common first.

Speaker 2
Yes. And common. And silver sign. But she's not going to know silver sign, so I'm trying the others. Yes.

Speaker 3
Statistically speaking, she is not going to know silver sign. Okay.

Speaker 2
And I've got to find another language.

Speaker 5
So my thing says I can understand and speak. Anything. Of course monks can do that. Why can't monks do that? Sure. Tell me the sun and moon.

Speaker 2
Does it matter?

Speaker 3
No. They can do it. Can a monk do it? Check the yes boxes all the way down. The one thing they can't do.

Speaker 1
Well, they no longer have all good saves.

Speaker 5
That's true. Yeah, I don't have that. And at 17th, I also stopped aging, and I'm unaffected by aging spells.

Speaker 2
I'm an elf. I don't have that problem.

Speaker 5
No, you still age.

Speaker 2
Yeah, but not in human time frames.

Speaker 3
Yeah, you're not an adult until 115.

Speaker 2
I'm an adult.

Speaker 3
Yeah, 115.

Speaker 5
Unfortunately, we're not getting the level 20 where I just become an outsider.

Speaker 2
I'm 124. I'm an adult.

Speaker 5
I get such peak humanity that I am no longer human. Like I said, 150 is adulthood.

Speaker 3
It's the equivalent of 18.

Speaker 1
So you only get older, but you would still die from old age. Correct. Right now. Until you get three levels, in which case you don't die from all the JMR. Correct.

Speaker 5
It seems curious. So what are you doing here?

Speaker 3
What language are you speaking? I'm speaking common.

Speaker 1
All of them. But it can understand me. It's language.

Speaker 5
You're speaking its soul language. So as a monk, and not a joke, I chose to do this as a monk. I only took common because I knew this would eventually happen. You're speaking their language.

Speaker 3
Oh, monsts are weird, man. It kind of... What are you doing?

Speaker 5
Oh, we're here to kill Rizali Throon for the fifth or sixth time. Sorry, what language is this?

Speaker 4
We're here in common.

Speaker 3
What languages do you speak?

Speaker 4
similar. I had well she didn't respond to me in common though. She did not. Common, Infernal, Elven, and Silver Sun.

Speaker 1
I'm speaking common but you don't

Speaker 3
you hear it saying words

Speaker 1
but you don't understand. I do understand it. Just because I'm cheating with magic. Traditional. I'm like months who

Speaker 5
just speak just soul language. I can just talk and understand anybody anywhere. I think you're just talking to their soul.

Speaker 3
Something like that. Makes sense.

Speaker 1
monks do it

Speaker 3
no it's their monks they're weird monks are weird man they are and I guess now her full head is above the water cause she needs to be able to communicate verbally um but she has no body below the surface I can just

Speaker 1
I got tongue communal I can just cast that

Speaker 4
on all of us right

Speaker 1
yeah

Speaker 4
her what tongue is communal

Speaker 1
yeah so we all just speak any language just like him

Speaker 4
yeah tongue is communal okay

Speaker 3
She has surfaced up too To her neck

Speaker 1
Well hello Kind lady what brings you here We are here to punish Thrun Brings me here A devil

Speaker 3
Of course a devil brings you here Why are you still here Well I can't Go through fire That's fair So I'm here. And I'm forced to sing when the lyre starts playing. Okay.

Speaker 5
Can I get that statue?

Speaker 4
Is there a lyre in the statue? There is a lyre in the statue.

Speaker 3
There is a silver lyre in the statue. And when I do, the walls rumble. And someone seems to be in great pain.

Speaker 1
Oh, so they're using your singing to torment Brasali through. I don't know what that is. That would be the guy screaming in great pain. Do you know why, then, here?

Speaker 3
Yes. I, uh, everyone roll a perception.

Speaker 1
40. 40.

Speaker 2
Brain functioning.

Speaker 4
Only a 24.

Speaker 2
30.

Speaker 3
Anyone have knowledge of nature other than Luther, who already tried? I do. Okay. Religion. Nature is the one you want.

Speaker 2
34, that's what I got.

Speaker 3
I barely have religion. 34?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 3
And something else?

Speaker 4
13, because I'm sickened right now. Everything's a negative on spells.

Speaker 3
this is a nirid a water net um a fake creature um largely associated with water um who got perception what was everyone's perception 48 right 40 40 yeah there's only four nine and 34 34 everyone but yizma notices the physical resemblance between this creature and the statue like uncannily so like they're not the same but as far as like human versus nymph goes they're close enough that it could cause some extra torment to a certain someone

Speaker 1
well I could definitely bring you to the material plane if you wanted to go wait what was the transmutation

Speaker 4
aura here

Speaker 1
That's a good question.

Speaker 4
That's what I'm curious about at this point.

Speaker 3
Only her head and neck are humanoid. You look at the surface of the water and it's just water underneath that. She's like a mermaid.

Speaker 1
She maybe has a water form or something.

Speaker 3
Except for Luthor who gets to see her full humanoid form.

Speaker 1
Oh, weird.

Speaker 3
Because true seeing is dumb.

Speaker 1
It's expensive, but it's so useful.

Speaker 4
I was just curious. You were saying something about releasing?

Speaker 1
Well, we could certainly send her back to the material plane. Calypso? Did you recognize her as a water nymph, too?

Speaker 3
Or did you get up near the knowledge of nature?

Speaker 4
Oh, that was only a 13. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Then, now you haven't pieced together what the transmutation is.

Speaker 1
Okay. Well, I mean, she obviously does not seem like she belongs here.

Speaker 3
I don't. I was kidnapped by a being of metal and fire. That sounds familiar-ish. Sense motive? Is she lying? She's not lying. Okay. Sorry, did you sense motive?

Speaker 1
She does sound like someone we can send home without sugar.

Speaker 4
I believe you're right. 24. Well, they said we know when we saw them. I'm minus in the second. I just want to see if she's telling the truth.

Speaker 3
Oh yeah, the creature of metal and fire is the best way she can describe it. She doesn't know what it was that kidnapped her other than it was a devil of metal and fire. Well, I mean, we could send her home. I don't think that would be a downside.

Speaker 2
I'm fine with that.

Speaker 3
As you say that she actually surfaces up to her torso. She's not standing on the water, but like she would be... I mean, she's not treading water, but she's up to her torso now. What? Nymph.

Speaker 1
Would she be willing to sing one final song before I send her back to the material point? I'm only supposed to do it when the Liars plays. Well, that's why I'm asking. Because if you're not supposed to, that makes it better, right?

Speaker 3
I don't understand the rules, so... Yes?

Speaker 5
Actually, I want to go... Can you...? So, I'm going to look at the... Right, but I don't know if it's conjunction with... I want to check out the statue with the liar.

Speaker 1
Would you be okay with us playing with the liar once before we send you home?

Speaker 5
I don't think we should play it. I'd like to see if the liar is stuck in the statue or is it just like... It is removable.

Speaker 1
I'll grab the wire.

Speaker 3
I guess the statue would have a magical transmutation as well. But it only activates every 1d3 hours, so it's either a remaining aura, a lingering aura.

Speaker 1
It's like an animation or something?

Speaker 3
Transmutation animation, yeah.

Speaker 5
So randomly, it plays, she sings, it hurts for Zali.

Speaker 3
It doesn't... it's not random. You said... It's definitely causing him pain. Oh, no, no. The song is... The pain in the...

Speaker 5
It's how often it happens is random. Within three hours. Yes. That's what I was talking about. Yes.

Speaker 3
Which is odd for a devil. You'd think they'd have it specifically... Yeah. Every hour on the hour or something like that.

Speaker 5
But to cause more pain, it doesn't give you a time that you actually, like, count in detail.

Speaker 3
Of course, if he's exposed to it every hour on the hour, he'd like a cuckoo clock in the house. He'd just start ignoring it.

Speaker 1
Exactly. Well, I suppose we could have someone try playing the lyre before we head out, or before we bring her home.

Speaker 2
Which one of you has magical or musical capability?

Speaker 3
It's a performing string instrument. Oh, my God, you do! I forgot you did that. Because you got a guitar way back.

Speaker 5
Stringed instruments. Way back in like. Did you really? Yes. So I can learn to play the Silver Song. Yep.

Speaker 2
Oh my god.

Speaker 3
Specifically.

Speaker 2
That is hilarious.

Speaker 3
Ironically, that is the tune that you need to play.

Speaker 5
That's the only thing I know.

Speaker 3
That's the only song you know. This is the song that never ends. Oh my god. Go ahead and roll your perform check and she starts singing the song of Silver. as he starts playing horribly. As he starts playing horribly the beautifulness of her voice counters the terribleness of Luther's attempt. And she actually starts setting the tempo and you start trying to play to catch up because your tempo was wrong. But she sings the actual Song of Silver and this whole room starts shaking reverberating violently. Then finally, as the last notes are played, you hear Brasali's voice yell out NARSALIA!

Speaker 1
Okay. So.

Speaker 4
NARSALIA.

Speaker 1
Well, does she have a preference on which plane to take her? I can take her to

Speaker 3
material. You can choose whatever plane you send me to? Let's go back to the water plane. I mean, whatever suits your decision is fine. Choose under the plane of fire.

Speaker 2
We're not going to win, though.

Speaker 3
No, I'm just kidding. Oh, sorry. Use my make-a-will-safe.

Speaker 4
That's right. I'm still in.

Speaker 3
Because you hate women. Yep. Okay. You don't even notice.

Speaker 2
That explains why we haven't become besties

Speaker 3
It's not a hindrance It's a phobia

Speaker 1
Okay I will send her Ideally to Kentargo Bay

Speaker 3
Not to the plane that she has to be sent to?

Speaker 1
If I had the plane to water I would I only have focuses Well maybe explain it to her before I will Remember this is plane shift

Speaker 3
Got it Okay. Is that a percentile or something?

Speaker 1
No, they have no words for it.

Speaker 3
So you just end up somewhere on the plane of where you're going.

Speaker 1
Oh, excuse me. Between five and five hundred miles off. Oh.

Speaker 3
Oh. Well, the dice are liking you today. Okay. The Bay of Quintargo, you said? Yeah. Okay. You feel pretty damn confident you'll... Give it up one piece. If you had to put a number to it, you'd say 94% positive that you'll get to the right location.

Speaker 1
Okay. Well, I mean, cool. As opposed to 5 times 94% far away from where I aimed.

Speaker 3
Oh, no. I rolled a percentile to see how close you were.

Speaker 1
That's what I meant. Yeah.

Speaker 3
94% accurate. Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 1
So it's only 20 miles off.

Speaker 3
Give or take.

Speaker 1
So yeah, she's actually in the Kitargo.

Speaker 3
Yeah, in the Bay of Kitargo or the inner ocean. Or the inner sea. Cool. Do you tell her anything? Or like have you a trip?

Speaker 1
I will tell her all I can send you to the prime material plane.

Speaker 2
But you can't guarantee that that's exactly where the water is. It's acceptable. But hey, she can move.

Speaker 3
It's better than apparently hell that I'm in. Yes, literally. Which I didn't quite piece together.

Speaker 1
Okay. She's not aiming for the will save, so willing, no save.

Speaker 3
Yeah, she's willing to leave here, assuming that you don't have to roll bluff because you weren't lying, right? I wasn't lying. I don't generally lie to people. Yeah, and she doesn't believe you were lying, so she doesn't need to... I generally don't tell people the truth. But I'm very bad at it. Congratulations, everyone. You feed one of the two souls within the tower. Cool. Win-win. Excellent.

Speaker 1
I only have two plane shifts. Because the plane shift is one I can send someone else somewhere without going with...

Speaker 3
Let me see where these portals lead, and we might have to call it here.

Speaker 2
It's 422.

Speaker 3
Because depending upon where these portals lead... Oh, yeah. That and... Oh, yeah. Either way, we're going to have to call it here.

Speaker 1
What are the two?

Speaker 3
It will be... C2, C3? C3 and C5.

Speaker 1
C3, C5. Okay.

Speaker 3
Or back to C1.

Speaker 1
Okay, I don't know what they are. That's okay. I will snapshot them and add them to the...

Speaker 3
Actually, if you want to just add all nine layers. Oh, sure. That way they'll be ready for... Let me see if I can't... And we're still on for next week? Yes. This is according to everyone? Yes. Nothing's changed. Okay, cool.

Speaker 2
Sorry about the back and forth, but I'd rather not have been upset about it here.

Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. I understand. I mean, I wasn't going to force you to do anything that you weren't comfortable with. Better here than here.

Speaker 2
Being up by my parents. Well, by my parents' house.

Speaker 3
So we'll see you guys same time, same night. Same back place, same back channel.

Speaker 1
So we're going to be here.

Speaker 3
We're going to be here 12:30 next week. And we're getting pretty close to the end of our sessions. Cool.

Speaker 2
Then what?

Speaker 3
I don't know. I'm going to take a break for a while. And then we'll figure something out. Cool. I've been doing this for seven years now. Yeah, I know, I know. It's not because you hate us. I can't believe it's been that long. It didn't seem like it would be when we were doing it every other week back when we started. That is true. And then we went once a month and then we went once every other month for a while. If we had kept the original schedule it wouldn't have been that long.

Speaker 1
So yeah, this seems close enough.

Speaker 3
Yeah, depending upon which story you go through. - Three, five. - He just means size wise. - Scale. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. These are five foot skits? - Yep. - Okay. - 'Cause yeah, I-- - 'Cause the mats are 10 square.

Speaker 1
- Yeah, I roughly scaled it the same as the other ones.

Speaker 3
'Cause-- - Just leave yourself on the bathhouse to decide which one you go to.

Speaker 2
- Sorry, excuse me.

Speaker 1
- 'Cause yeah, um-- - I know you can see 'em all, but-- - Yeah, I'm not really paid. I don't have any labels, and I don't know what I'm looking at quite intentionally. - Yeah. but now let's save town center save save as town center well it's still town center because tower bone oh that's the same map as uh i have one map for all of this pretty much yes so for

Speaker 3
example oh there's the cave and dragon skeleton that's being harvested by the albaster academy

Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm missing some other stuff.

Speaker 3
Oh, that's where you weren't going to fight Batman, because that's not where you found him. Oh, bathhouse. Bathhouse. I'll take a nice...

Speaker 1
I'm looking at a very compressed version of it. But yeah, I realized the spell I cast, actually making it large, so I cast a different spell that does. Ah. So, the other spell that does make me large does also have a fear aura. Enemy creatures within the aura have a check, and if they hit me, the check goes away. Or they're no longer shaking. Up?

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. Checking out a minus two penalty?

Speaker 1
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, so enemy creatures within the aura... Oh, shit. Okay, so basically, they're just shaken by being in the aura. It's 30-foot aura. No save on that part. However, every time they're shaken with me and hit me, they become frightened for a D4 rounds. And then at the end of it, they're no longer shaken. This is the side effect of this.

Speaker 3
Shaken, then scared, then immune?

Speaker 1
Yes. But the thing is, this is the side effect of
