Speaker 1
higher. Well, 14 or higher.

Speaker 2
You reduce it by 10 with the oops of rope.

Speaker 1
I have rope. I always carry rope. Because rope's important. As well as a hook.

Speaker 2
I took two ranks of climb. Yep. So you can reduce that DC by 10 if you have rope. You just want it?

Speaker 1
I want to see how it's situated to see if there's meaning about it or if it's been damaged.

Speaker 2
Just jump up and grab it otherwise. Do you want that? Do you? Mario? Mario's doink sound. Doink.

Speaker 3
I might have to double jump.

Speaker 1
I just made it. Just. It wasn't an easy climb, but I made it up there.

Speaker 2
So you go back up the little bit. I'm exhausted from the level drain earlier.

Speaker 1
I'm up there, checking out this leg bone. Is there any other bones around? Is there a trail of bones?

Speaker 2
As you approach this leg bone, it's kind of pressed against the wall. Pressed into? As best I can. Like, someone just get into the wall. And you're like, huh, that's odd. And as you look down this trail, you see half of a rib cage further down the way.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
estimate the left half? If you had to estimate?

Speaker 1
Do I see the right half?

Speaker 2
Or just the left half?

Speaker 1
There's no other pieces? Just that one piece?

Speaker 2
As you keep looking down this pathway you're like, why is there half of a ribcage? The left half of a ribcage. That's weird.

Speaker 1
Eccchio ribcage. Damn, it doesn't work here. I'm going to cautiously go and check it out

Speaker 2
alright so you go up to this rib cage and you're like man that's weird

Speaker 1
can you see if it's been like severed with something like sharp like a dagger or a sword

Speaker 2
no it looks like it's been smashed like the other half of this rib cage is probably in multiple places

Speaker 1
you would wait for it was just something that died

Speaker 2
and as you get to this rib cage you look up and you see portions of a skull further down the way.

Speaker 1
That's pretty... Something pulled us apart. It wasn't just like a oh, I died here situation. And if the dragon's also dead, then it probably likely wasn't the dragon. So... Because there's nothing notable where the dragon's stomach could be.

Speaker 4
We hear her up in the distance kind of mumbling to herself.

Speaker 2
You guys are too fascinated by dragon bones. Human bones didn't interest you enough.

Speaker 1
I move a little bit forward towards the skull, but not all the way up to it.

Speaker 2
Okay. So as you approach this skull, you're like, oh man, that's like squished. And you look up and you see seven different limbs. Bones of limbs.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
Hands, arms, legs.

Speaker 1
In a pile?

Speaker 2
Nope, just kind of thrown about. Does anybody get in a funeral? Make a sense motive.

Speaker 1
I can't. I can't look at my computer. Oh. Give me a minute. It's almost done. Come on. I can't sense a motive if I can't see what I'm rolling.

Speaker 2
1D20 plus something. Great.

Speaker 1
Oh, come on. Yes, welcome. Thank you.

Speaker 4
Thanks for helping me harvest these bones, by the way. These will be worth a lot of money.

Speaker 2
Or did you just wrap the meteor hammer around your fist?

Speaker 3
I just hit it. I realized I hit harder than a meteor hammer ever would. I was like, oh. Yeah. I hit his Adimantine now, so I'm good. So unless something's really weird.

Speaker 2
Even with your ridiculous Adimantine punching, You are still having trouble, especially with the horns. The horns gave you some real workout.

Speaker 3
Hold on.

Speaker 2
I got another ability. The teeth were a little jammed in there, but you kept tugging them out pretty good. But the horns took a while to get at. Shattering punch. Is it an evil outsider? Sense motive? No. Okay.

Speaker 1
Then 20.

Speaker 2
20? All right, so as you're looking at these randomly displayed limbs around here, like... This was... You ever... You know those smash rooms that you can just go into and hit things with a hammer?

Speaker 1
Never been anyone that I've heard of about them.

Speaker 2
I've never been anyone either, originally. Imagine that. But instead of objects that you get to smash in this room... It's people. It's bones. It's human bones. human-sized bones, at least. Just, like, and as you, like, CD7, you, like, kind of squint a little bit in the dim light, even though you don't need to because you're an elf. And you, like, look around, it's, like, it's that version, that room, but body parts was the smashing stuff. Someone came through here with a whirlwind of hatred, and the remains of whatever it is are just scattered about, smashed up, and destroyed. Make a perception check.

Speaker 1
You want me to just blink? Because that would be easier. 46. Okay. I rolled a 20.

Speaker 2
Okay. So you also noticed in different portions of this room smashed around is a bunch of equipment, too. As well as there's two raised 20-foot raised paths in this. But um, plateaus. Um, in this section. And you know something glistening? 46? On both of those two.

Speaker 1
Alright. It's how high?

Speaker 2
Each one is 20 feet. And they're on the north and south end of this chamber.

Speaker 1
I'm not going to get them on my own unless I climb again.

Speaker 2
You can fly.

Speaker 1
I already used my flag for today. I have to wait. Once a day. We haven't rested yet. No, but it was

Speaker 3
X amount of time once a day. I don't think so. You can break it up into as many X's as you want as long as it's a minute.

Speaker 1
It's like one hour a day or something like that but it's but that fight time had been long enough

Speaker 3
i didn't think you could separate the fight with the dragon did not take an hour despite what it seemed the fight actually felt more like uh less than i mean certainly less than

Speaker 2
30 seconds despite what it felt like as the dragon nearly ripped you guys limb from them

Speaker 4
Summon monster, a wonderful spell, could cast at any level a bunch of rats that are 60 feet above somebody's head. And the fall for that per rat is 1d6 for every 10 feet. So that's 66 of fall damage just for one rat. Let's say five rats are out there.

Speaker 3
That's a lot of damage, and they can't dodge the damage. It's automatic hit. So it's not very long. Actually, somebody else came up with that with bugbears. And dropping bugbears take no damage from fall either.

Speaker 1
That's even better.

Speaker 3
Why do bugbears not take fall? I don't know. It's a weird thing. They're just goblinoids. It's something weird that had to do with it. Because bugbears were used in particular because when they fall, they're not going to die and they can keep attacking.

Speaker 1
What the...

Speaker 4
I didn't clip on any of the way. That's a clever use of the spell. It is. I don't need the thing to actually bite the thing. I just need to fall on them.

Speaker 3
Right. Now imagine when it falls and is able to still bite.

Speaker 4
It still gets its attack on the way down.

Speaker 3
The bugbear... It's a bludgeoning weapon. It's the bug bear paratroopers Essentially The bug bear paratroopers That's awesome The bug bear airborn Except they don t have parachutes You just drop them

Speaker 4
Such a clever use of that spell I never thought of doing that A bunch of clubs hit you from above And you can't dodge them Because they're just falling

Speaker 1
How close to the edge are they?

Speaker 2
the glistening far you'd have to be on the plateau to figure out what's up there it just caught your eye because you have low light vision and you've rolled 46

Speaker 1
guys I need someone to throw me

Speaker 2
we're not up by you

Speaker 1
I can yell down to you

Speaker 2
so both of you roll a perception

Speaker 3
if it's more

Speaker 1
if it's more than there's something i can't reach

Speaker 3
32 i'm 32 i'm about there if not more than skills i was looking up my my other skill

Speaker 4
like what's the funnier is if we choose to ignore her and she's like i know you guys can hear me

Speaker 1
I'm hardly a rascal for nothing. 44.

Speaker 4
I've heard you hear the faintest of sounds in the night. Right.

Speaker 1
I was in the room when Luther farted and I did say a damn thing.

Speaker 4
I think she's talking. I hear her say something.

Speaker 1
You hear...

Speaker 3
I've got red language so I can understand it no matter what.

Speaker 4
You understand the intent. It's very echoey.

Speaker 2
And the fact that she's over 100 feet from you guys, it makes it hard to actually understand.

Speaker 4
I do think, in all seriousness, we should probably go check up on her, because she has wandered off on her own before. Do you remember the pit? And we've had to...

Speaker 2
We've had to assist... That's right, I threw you into a pit. We've had to assist her a few times, though, so... I threw you into a pit of acid, didn't I? You did. We should probably...

Speaker 1
I cast the pit of acid. What are you talking about? The pit was already there. I cast that. I made that happen.

Speaker 2
Oh, yeah. That's right. Oh, yeah. No, I just sneak attacked you with an assassin that time. That's all. Right.

Speaker 4
We were into her own pit.

Speaker 2
She was hovering over her own pit. She was. Because she had fly in place. So she was just unconscious and twirling in the air. I thought... That's right. ...the pit of acid that she saw.

Speaker 3
unconscious just

Speaker 2
she was unconscious and circling above the pit of acid that she summoned underneath her

Speaker 4
yeah so we should probably go get her is what I'm saying

Speaker 2
she might be unconscious and floating over an acid pit

Speaker 4
because I can't I don't know what she said

Speaker 1
how would I be talking hello

Speaker 4
you have weird abilities we can't really understand you I don't know what she's saying but it might be important

Speaker 3
we'll go I will climb up there.

Speaker 4
I'm treating it as not an emergent issue because I know her well enough now. I'm like, eh, she's probably...

Speaker 1
If I'm not answering, then it's a bigger problem. Let's see.

Speaker 4
It's when somebody else is screaming. I have to worry about it. I'm like, oh, what's she doing? I kind of climb up also, but I have no climbing. I could let down a row. Oh, a 15. Okay. 19. I think there's like hand holds and stuff.

Speaker 2
Yep. You guys both get back up. Fairly easy-ish. I think it was from this way. Oh yeah, she doesn't have a light source, so you're not entirely sure. But, since you did mention the human bone, and there's only one place that had a human bone. And as you come around this, walkway, you notice all the different bones. I still have light

Speaker 4
casted on something of mine I remember from last time, so I'm using it as a light source.

Speaker 2
Oh, do you have a light source too?

Speaker 4
Yeah, sorry.

Speaker 2
Good to know.

Speaker 4
Because I do not have any kind of low light or whatever.

Speaker 2
Low light, you treat all this as normal light. You have 20 feet of normal light and everything beyond that has 20% mischance. For those who are not able to see in the low light.

Speaker 4
It's a multi-material printer, so it's re-rolling filament and I'm feeding a different color through because somebody's doing like a multi-color print. So that's why you're hearing all that whirring.

Speaker 1
That green thing that I do?

Speaker 4
Oh no, that's somebody who does drop spindle stuff for yarn and wool. And that's a spindle for the drop spindle that she's trying to design a new type of drop spindle. That's the printer below it. Doing all the whirring. I think he's printing one of the original Star Trek Enterprise ships. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

Speaker 2
Yeah, and you guys eventually come into this chamber where... Do you want to... That's bad. Yeah, the chamber of... The chamber of... As we just walked out, it's... Why would he write... If he was being killed?

Speaker 4
It's on the wall.

Speaker 2
Do you want to look around the ground floor? before these guys catch up to you?

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I'm searching through whatever's on the ground. Because you said that there was some stuff that was dropped, so I'm looking around. There's a lot of things. There's knapsacks and crap looking around.

Speaker 2
Yeah, sure, knapsacks, but you probably want the valuable stuff.

Speaker 1
Well, yeah, loose change.

Speaker 2
Loose change?

Speaker 1
Well, whatever I can find.

Speaker 4
Perception of 32, just as we're walking down this corridor, of anything interesting as we're walking along? I think we're just preparing these bones right now.

Speaker 2
Yeah, you pieced together that these bones were hurled about, like I described, like a rage room style. Somebody had a feast. No, something was super pissed off and needed to let out some rage. Really?

Speaker 4
So they're snapped and cracked and splintered?

Speaker 2
Like thrown against the cave walls. Sometimes there's even impaled bones in the rock face. Like someone rage quit in this room.

Speaker 4
Heal of 30, which is a really good rule actually for me. Oh no, I'm sorry. Heal of 18.

Speaker 3
You're healing the bones?

Speaker 4
No, no, I want to know if it was thrown in raw flesh. Like somebody took pieces of somebody and threw them and there's like flesh that decayed around it. Or if it was actually somebody just tossing a bunch of bones after they were already bones.

Speaker 2
28?

Speaker 4
18, sorry.

Speaker 2
they were more meaty at some point it does not look like the bones were gnawed on but I think whatever was tearing these things apart got rid of all this squishy stuff pretty quickly

Speaker 4
so they did not decay in the place they are here now they must have been decayed before they were placed in this position

Speaker 2
They were brought into this place, and then something got angry. I get that. The bones, not the fleshy bits. There's large portions of mushrooms throughout this chamber as well, in different corners and such. The mushrooms are attracted to the softer tissue. So what person's softer tissue is where those landed. There's larger patches of mushrooms in this chamber.

Speaker 4
Okay, so it does look like something was ripped apart or ripped up.

Speaker 2
Ripped apart.

Speaker 4
I think the bones brought in and going.

Speaker 2
Well, the bones, it feels like they were ripped apart, thrown about, but the bones were the ones that got the most damage because they were the sturdiest. Yeah. So they got more of the beatings, but whatever was here had flesh, muscles, organs, because of the numerous amounts of mushroom patches in this chamber. So they were alive when this happened. That's it.

Speaker 3
Alive or... They were alive or in one piece. Or in one piece, right?

Speaker 4
When they were bought into the... Or just freshly dead, or... If you guys have fun, I can turn off the heat, by the way. I think it's set to, like, 66 right now.

Speaker 2
As you scrimp about, you notice some things that are easier to pocket than other things on this cavern floor, including 20 bejeweled unholy symbols of Asmodeus, and you estimate each one is worth 250 gold pieces. you find some weapons and armor that's not easy as to pocket and such.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm not interested in that.

Speaker 2
You do notice five runes that you can pocket pretty easily. You can spend some time with Spellcraft or Naldircana no, Spellcraft to identify them or you can just pocket all five of them. Put them in a container for now. There's a ruby encrusted rod that you could pocket pretty easily. Yeah, but that means to detect magic, right?

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 2
Okay. That's why you're able to find these things as quickly as you are. There's a small bag that's giving off a good... A bag?

Speaker 1
A small bag?

Speaker 2
Yep. A haversack, if you will. That's giving off some radiation. and then that one you could probably fit in your backpack without them noticing. But about that time as you get that bag into the thing is when you hear voices

Speaker 4
coming like, damn, there's a lot on your summoning of Uber and then while Uber's on its way quickly looting the place before Uber gets there. You need to come and tell Barbie while they're coming. To be fair, she left

Speaker 2
all the armor and armor Arms and armor. I know. I'm just saying it's a funny like, you know, hit the button for retrieve. Guys, I need some help with getting up somewhere else that's better than what we have here. I swear. What did you find?

Speaker 1
Nothing? Nothing. Oh, uh, guys, there's some things. I didn't want to get up there, but I can't reach.

Speaker 2
Uh, she points up there's two ledges in this room, about 20 feet up. These ones are smoother, um, but there are, like, chunks of anger bones sticking out of them that you could use

Speaker 4
too well. So it's like bouldering.

Speaker 2
Yeah, it actually seems easier to climb here. As long as those bones stay sturdy as you use them as handholds. I look at Luthor. Luthor probably looks at me and I'm like, well, you're the one going to do the toss-in. Nobody tosses a dwarf.

Speaker 1
I'm an elf. I'm okay.

Speaker 4
Hoop, hop, alley-oop. You just have to fold her into a spear and chuck her up there. Like a cartoon.

Speaker 1
Or a gummy hair up and... Since 20 feet, now I'm only 5 foot something. So, 5 foot, like 2.

Speaker 2
So... You would imagine it's probably... No, I said that either.

Speaker 1
Can you launch me about 15 feet in the air?

Speaker 2
12, do you see 12 climb?

Speaker 1
12? I could try, but I've only got a 1, so...

Speaker 2
Nope. So you're like, oh man, it's a good thing all these bones are in place, and you reach up and grab like two of them. By the time you reach the third one, it comes out of the wall, and you're just like dangling off of one bone.

Speaker 1
Like, yeah, that's a good work.

Speaker 2
I suddenly got disgusted with the fact that I'm using bones as handholds to climb this wall, and you just drop down like half a foot.

Speaker 4
I'm going to send my... I'm going to send Kronk up there. Okay.

Speaker 2
Does Kronk have a little light vision or dark vision? Yeah, he's a little fairy dragon. Okay. I wasn't sure what kind of... I'm sure he has some kind of vision, but I wasn't sure which. true scene, maybe? Yeah. Does he? He seems too low a level to have true scene.

Speaker 1
I could send the fucking owl up there. Why didn't I think of that?

Speaker 2
I have his sheep.

Speaker 1
See, I keep forgetting I got

Speaker 2
the fucking owl. Are you guys doing this at the same time? Yeah. Okay, so do you want the north or the south? Roll initiative. See who gets to choose.

Speaker 4
Oh, damn, I'm not going to say what I want. I just rolled a 20. Damn it.

Speaker 1
If it's a plus the 9, then it's 29.

Speaker 4
29? Yeah, I'm a 22. Okay.

Speaker 2
Do you want the North Cliff or the South Cliff?

Speaker 1
North Cliff.

Speaker 2
North Cliff. All right. um so your owl goes uh what's your owl's intelligence and it can communicate with you verbally right yeah okay

Speaker 1
i don't have any of that written down anywhere i just don't have an owl i got a familiar it was an owl that's all i got out of that i'll have to work on that Why do I have that?

Speaker 2
I'll put the spoon or it has at least 12 intelligence so I'll get to describe.

Speaker 1
All I have to do is

Speaker 2
so your flying compatriots go out one north, one south. Low light for me.

Speaker 1
Bring anything that looks good down to us.

Speaker 2
Bring anything that looks good down. Okay. It's my familiar by the way.

Speaker 1
I mean there's a sparkly up there. Go get the sparkly.

Speaker 2
It flies up, kills my first familiar, and is eaten by a giant toad. What?

Speaker 1
Again?

Speaker 2
Again.

Speaker 1
Is that 70 toad? I've lost. How many times have you lost familiar this time?

Speaker 2
Have you lost familiar being eaten by...

Speaker 3
If I had a gold coin for each one, I'd have three, but...

Speaker 4
Because I've never used it. Because I've never used it, the point when my familiar gets up to an area that's stable, I want to switch places with it, because I took that spell a while back. It's essentially... I need that spell. It's companion transposition. You trade places with my familiar, teleporting as if you were both affected by dimension door.

Speaker 2
Okay, so he goes up there and is like, holy shit! And you're like... Yeah, pretty much. As you see what's on the southern cliff, is a huge amount of... You have magical sight. Oh, totally, yeah. Magical sight? Big old aura. Oh, God. So you see a horrendous amount of magic just bursting on this cliff face. You're like, oh, my God. It's like the lights in the Christmas vacation. And you realize there was a dragon who lived here, and now it all makes sense. It's a horde. Because as you look... It's a horde! There's a horde. I'll start on the southern cliff. Are you ready? Because there's a lot. You see a bag of holding, type 3.

Speaker 4
I'm recording to transcribe what we did

Speaker 2
and you peek into it and it has all these different rare spices and a quick estimation of what's inside. You'd wager 2,800 gold pieces worth of spices inside this bag of holding. There's a heavy chandelier sculpted in silver and hung with aquamarines. You'd wager a chandelier? Yep. 8,800 gold pieces. walking around with a chandelier. You notice a luck blade that is in a scabbard of keen edges. There's a ring of telekinesis. There's a mace of smiting. There's a gem of seeing. There's a seventh level pearl of power. There's a rod of wonder. There's a suit of breastplate adamantine armor, plus four. there's a plus five heavy fortification mithril chain shirt there's a white robe of the magi, arch magi there's a set of wings of the gargoyle and an orb of utter chaos

Speaker 4
now I have an orb of utter chaos, I don't need that

Speaker 2
why do you have an orb of utter chaos

Speaker 4
when did you get that? wait, wait, wait, wait, maybe it's not I thought I remember an orb.

Speaker 3
He just has the orb of chaos, not utter chaos.

Speaker 4
Oh, sorry.

Speaker 3
The lesser person.

Speaker 4
I thought I had. I don't have an orb. I thought I for some reason did. So right away, I'm going to take the ring of telekinesis.

Speaker 2
Okay. And you look across where the owl is on the northern cliff, and you see a vast amount of gems and coins. I obviously got the better of the two.

Speaker 1
And the owl's like, I can't get all these. Can you just come up here?

Speaker 2
The owl grabs a coin, a platinum coin, and flies back down to you. That's sparkly.

Speaker 1
That's not sparkly.

Speaker 2
It is very sparkly. A platinum coin is ten gold pieces. And it, like, sits on your shoulder and goes,

Speaker 1
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. Smart ass.

Speaker 2
And it looks at you, and it does that weird, like, owl 90-degree neck turn, or 100-degree neck turn, as it looks back up to the northern cliff. And then it turns back to you again as like times that by... I can't even math that high.

Speaker 4
Tens of thousands. So I'm going to go back to the ledge. And I'm going to yell down, I think our funding issues, if we ever had any, are gone. I start going through some of the things that are up here. And the reason I took the ring of telekinesis, and I let everybody know I took this ring of telekinesis, is because then I can bring stuff down if we need to using telekinesis rather than us doing it all. But anyway, so there's this large horde up here on my side. I think there's something sparkly over on your side over there.

Speaker 2
Oh, you absolutely can see this horde of wealth. There's a lot over there. In the end, as you telekinesis and fly up and down and climb up and down, however you get this guy down, it takes a while, but you get in coins. you get 71,500 gold pieces I'll notice all three of you are writing this down make sure that only this gets counted one time you get 5,300 platinum pieces you get a bag of gems that you guys estimate is worth 51,000 gold pieces. On a week of praise check. And you find two sculpt busts of a nameless man and woman plated in gold and studded with gems. You wager each one is worth 1,500 gold pieces.

Speaker 1
Do we have enough space to put busts?

Speaker 2
I don't think we need to take everything. Now that he has a bag of holding type 3, yes, you do have enough space. Also, those dragon horns that you were worried about carrying, you have space for them now. Bag of Holden type 3 is a large amount of carrying space.

Speaker 1
How much were the busts?

Speaker 2
Worth $1,500 each. You guys are set for the rest of your life, and that's how the campaign ends. You all just retire. who retired. You're like, I don't care if he becomes genocide Loki anymore. Kintarger's like, what happened to the Silver Ravens? I think they retired. I think they retired for like, ever.

Speaker 1
Well, that's my friend. The Razor.

Speaker 4
I want to see the...

Speaker 1
Great. No, I don't have

Speaker 4
the Skrulls. What the fuck? Did I say Skrulls? No, I was talking to myself about the Skrulls. Oh, um,

Speaker 2
so Luthor, while they're busy with their excapades around you can grab 12 plus 1 heavy maces this is on drone level 7 plus 1 light maces 8 plus 1 breastplates with the symbol of Asmodeus on them

Speaker 1
we're gonna get rich do do do do do

Speaker 2
and what is it?

Speaker 4
Before we just before we start taking some of this stuff I want to take Max's cardboard and turn him around facing the wall like

Speaker 1
I can't see it! You guys are walking around all kind of bejeweled and everything what happened?

Speaker 4
We've got bling we can't even be stealthy anymore because we've got all this bling hanging up he's like why'd you get all that?

Speaker 2
Why are you guys so shiny? I just wanted to be gold plated. You mean like get gold plating? No. Did I? Did I stutter? Did I stutter? I said gold plated.

Speaker 4
Okay, so we found a dragon horde. We'll make note of this dragon horde. Because I'm assuming we're going to come back at some point, right? uh we should just make this to our new hideout um do me a favor roll the 1d4 minus one

Speaker 3
oh everybody no just him

Speaker 2
um i haven't even pulled any dice out yet is it a mind effect enchantment because the guy he's got

Speaker 4
hidden that's going to kill us all right now. I was immune to mind-affecting.

Speaker 3
No, not at all.

Speaker 4
I'm just... yeah.

Speaker 3
Because I looked up one thing. And this could be something absolutely crazy. Is that 1d4 minus 1? 1d4 minus 1.

Speaker 2
Uh, 0.

Speaker 3
Okay, so there are no wishes

Speaker 2
in the luck blade. There aren't, actually. It wouldn't have mattered what I rolled because this luck blade has 0 wishes. You just proved that. I mean, yes. Not that you could be able to test that.

Speaker 1
If it had one, we could just wish for Asmodeus to be gone. That'd be the end of it.

Speaker 2
It would not.

Speaker 1
Yes, it would.

Speaker 2
I'd ask Asmodeus as a god.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, Asmodeus isn't the issue here. I wish for a turkey sandwich. It's dry!

Speaker 4
It's dry!

Speaker 3
Well, to be fair, I've already wasted one wish. So, we're good. Oh my god.

Speaker 2
But to be fair, that was the best cupcake of your life. Best what? Cupcake. It got spread on me. That's right. You impulsively needed to... I don't even remember why you didn't try and save it. You just had to do it there.

Speaker 3
The genie was going to leave. He's like, I will give you one, grant you a wish before I leave. I'm like, I want a cupcake. Yeah, he gave him a cupcake and returned to the play-bear. And nobody was around me, so the defense was like, nobody was there to ask me what I wanted.

Speaker 2
Eventually, they did walk into the kitchen and you were like licking the icing off of your fingers. For the one cupcake that was in the kitchen, apparently. I always forget that Luther used a wish to get a cupcake.

Speaker 3
I'm just really happy nobody else truly got the idea that it was a good wish. No, I meant like it was like a, like, we didn't have to bring down this entire fort.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I wish to go to the load-bearing section of this fort so we can smash it. Or I wish to know the exact location of the commander of this fort. I want a cupcake. Okay.

Speaker 4
That's fair. I want a cupcake.

Speaker 2
To be fair, it was a lesser wish. So, I mean, there were limits on it. But you still use a lesser wish to get a cupcake.

Speaker 3
Whoa. That means there is a potential that there is a greater cupcake out there.

Speaker 2
There is, in fact. But to be fair, it still is the best cupcake you've ever had. Correct. Until you find a real full-fledged genie who will grant you a non-limited wish. I like that I know I have hope You know I have hope Hey Yzma you know how to summon things right Can you call a genie I need to test something out A non-limited wish cupcake Oh my god But no questions Just summon Alright so Now that I'm glad That you guys didn't skip that hallway I don't feel so bad that was hilarious

Speaker 1
you just missed out on thousands upon thousands upon thousands

Speaker 2
I mean the gold alone was 51,000 or 51,000 that was gold alone so

Speaker 1
if you didn't even back because you decided not to come today just ask him for a

Speaker 2
split three ways

Speaker 3
quite honestly split three ways that would even a quarter would double my savings right now. And I have a lot of fucking money. Oh yeah, because you don't spend it.

Speaker 2
I don't spend it. You don't need armor or weapons or the magical items that you have. You're like, yeah, that's good enough. I don't need any better. Well, to start

Speaker 3
like the belt, I have the belt of perfect perfection.

Speaker 1
I have 38,000 gold pieces

Speaker 3
right now. And without that... Plus what? Plus 4 per? Because it does Con, Strength, and Dex.

Speaker 2
That's physical perfection does all three, but I wasn't sure if it was like plus 6, plus 4, plus 2, plus...

Speaker 3
I think it...

Speaker 2
You could probably afford a better one.

Speaker 3
No, it's a plus 6. It was one of them that Brasali was wearing, one of the big bads was wearing it. Yeah. And it cost me like everything plus what I had at the moment. Yeah. For the half.

Speaker 2
It was a big one.

Speaker 1
Besides, I didn't get any dragon bones, so me pocketing that couple of things...

Speaker 2
Dragon bones aren't worth shit. So, do you want to write this down in our inventory so I don't forget to tell you later?

Speaker 4
I'll hold on.

Speaker 2
Aside from those prices that I gave you, that rod, that ruby rod that you stuck in your pocket?

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 2
It's a rod of lesser Quicken meta magic?

Speaker 1
Rod of Lesser... Quicken?

Speaker 2
Quicken Metamagic.

Speaker 1
Metamagic?

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 1
What the frick is Metamagic?

Speaker 2
And inside that handy haversack, there are ten potions of Cure Serious Wounds. Three scrolls of Restoration.

Speaker 1
Three scrolls.

Speaker 2
and two scrolls of raised dead.

Speaker 1
Because, you know, if I ever want to raise the dead and become my own necromancer.

Speaker 2
No, raised... Oh yeah, raised dead does bring him back as undead. Or does he raise him as a life? You definitely look up the spell specifically. Still. It either brings someone back to life, or it raises undead. I don't remember.

Speaker 3
Hey, I want the wings of a gargoyle.

Speaker 2
Wings of a gargoyle? The wings of a gargoyle.

Speaker 4
What did I miss?

Speaker 2
The one who is easiest, most likely to fly, wants the wings of a gargoyle.

Speaker 1
I've also got those five rings, which...

Speaker 2
Oh, yeah. No, all five of those rings are a ring of protection plus one.

Speaker 3
I would definitely pay for the wings of the Gargoyle unless somebody else wants them.

Speaker 4
Nope. I already have wings of my own, so you're good.

Speaker 3
They're only good for five minutes each day, but for five minutes each day, I have DR-10 to Admin-T.

Speaker 2
And the ability to fly?

Speaker 3
And the ability to fly.

Speaker 2
I'm sorry. Why would they be wings of the Gargoyle if they're not?

Speaker 3
Yeah, you could fly.

Speaker 4
too but also you can fly dr 10 adamantine oh and it fits on the shoulder slot so it does so you can still wear armor i don't wear armor i mean my point is yeah somebody who wears armor yeah wear armor right but they'd lose their cloak what's that i don't wear a cloak yeah yeah i mean if you

Speaker 2
have wear and they got like straps around your shoulders yep it's the same as like a cloak so If you have a cloak, you'd lose that.

Speaker 4
Furl and unfurl them as a swift action. That's pretty cool.

Speaker 2
But you'd figure I'd wear a cape. I mean, if it's a mundane cape, you can wear a mundane cape and a magical.

Speaker 4
Right. What you could do, because you can do it for five minutes, right? And you can break it up into like one minute segments. You can fly up really high for a minute and then fall in a direction and then fly up and fall and get further.

Speaker 3
Get yourself a parachute.

Speaker 1
You could just, you know, paraglide down.

Speaker 3
But you only have 60 feet.

Speaker 1
Like a squirrel suit.

Speaker 3
So I miss the ability that I could have gotten at 8 to actually give myself flight at my movement. At your movement. I have to end. The key of it is I have to end on the ground. So it's just a really big...

Speaker 2
Or a surface that can support me.

Speaker 3
Like the original Superman jump.

Speaker 4
Exactly.

Speaker 2
So it's the appearance of flight. Yeah, you would definitely not ever let that cat escape the rooftop. Exactly. Like, I thought the rooftop runner feat was a great feat. Rooftop runner.

Speaker 4
Get over here.

Speaker 2
You are never slowed by rooftops, by any surfaces on rooftops. And you get plus ten jumping. Plus you have the spool of endless rope that you use with the Spider-Man. It's been a while since you've had to chase the cat. I don't think you would get away anymore. Not that you did it the first time either.

Speaker 3
The killer is just my speed.

Speaker 2
It was hard to outrun you. Even with Rooftop Runner, it was hard to get away from you.

Speaker 4
Do you prefer if we want another item or two from this pile that we choose now, or can I wait until I transcribe later and get the full list and then just choose a couple things from that later on and improve it with you.

Speaker 2
Yeah, if anyone wants to claim something now, otherwise, you know, when we get time to sell or whatever.

Speaker 4
Well, I just don't know what I want to all take with us. I'd rather not waste time in the session to go through numbers if you don't want to. As soon as I found out what these are.

Speaker 1
Open set. Sort it later. That's what I did.

Speaker 3
I want the wings now because that could be helpful. That's true. Yeah, totally. That's why I took the ring.

Speaker 4
And I'm like, well, just to move things. It's only a ninth level spell.

Speaker 1
I got a small handy haversack. It's handy.

Speaker 2
Yeah, and all the items that were inside of it that these two don't know about.

Speaker 1
Can you reach okay?

Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm just kind of semi-racing.

Speaker 1
A little stick. A little push broom.

Speaker 2
So, continuing on towards the grove of dragon shrooms.

Speaker 4
Are we going back towards where we are?

Speaker 2
Right. Pathway that leads south and then towards the west. Sounds good. This is a nice find.

Speaker 1
I'm glad I came back.

Speaker 2
I would have felt really guilty if you guys didn't get that treasure. After that dragon fight. That's a good stuff, man. After that dragon fight and you just walk past the treasure room. What treasure? What are you talking about?

Speaker 4
I don't remember no treasure I grab Max and turn him away from the wall Hey, we ready to go, buddy?

Speaker 2
Remind me when I do the recap that I'll just skip this portion of the recap

Speaker 4
Yes! That'd be hilarious

Speaker 2
You don't have to, it's just I think that'd be a funny story You guys continue stumbling around in the dark

Speaker 1
What did I get? I'm sorry, can you find a drink?

Speaker 4
So they all walked over here and they saw this shiny thing up in the corner and all of a sudden you saw Yizma turn you towards the wall for like 30 minutes and then all of a sudden she turns you back and says, let's go. No longer do you see the shiny bits up against the wall.

Speaker 1
Bates them to the ground.

Speaker 4
Sense motive in carbiditis. I think she's hiding something. Are you good?

Speaker 3
Are you good with the carrying of weight?

Speaker 4
Yeah, I've got sex to put stuff in.

Speaker 3
Well, I'm talking about the bag of holding. Oh. The bag of holding is 35 pounds on its own. Oh, yeah, I can, yeah. I'm not over-encumbered at all.

Speaker 4
I literally am... So I'm grabbing that bag of holding is what you're saying?

Speaker 3
Somebody is. I was just wondering if you're carrying it or not. I can carry it.

Speaker 4
Does this say pre-filled bag of holding?

Speaker 3
No, this is that one with the... Yeah, it has the... It has some spices. It has the spices in it, but it holds up to 1,000 pounds and 150 cubic feet of space.

Speaker 4
Oh, it's the type 3.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Is anyone taking the white robe of the Archmagi?

Speaker 4
I can take that.

Speaker 2
Or just taking it with you. We're taking it with. Yeah, taking it with you. I know you strapped on those wings as you were looking for something. Or did you not strap on? That's what I thought. That's what I had interpreted that you did.

Speaker 1
I don't wear anything until we're sure. I'm 100% sure it's not curse.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. Curses suck. I don't have any ability to fight curse. I really don't.

Speaker 2
So did anyone put on that robe of the arch the white robe of the arch

Speaker 4
can I do a knowledge arcana on it so I know what it is sure okay

Speaker 3
if I may not I would assume that the Hedgehog's were going to wear

Speaker 4
25

Speaker 2
25? oh yeah it's not cursed oh okay what did you get?

Speaker 1
I got 13

Speaker 2
it's cursed

Speaker 1
like I ain't wearing that

Speaker 2
oh but yeah 25 whatever you said is enough to what color was the robe? white

Speaker 1
not blendy enough for me

Speaker 4
let me see if that even helps me

Speaker 1
it's not even green

Speaker 4
does that even do anything?

Speaker 1
yeah it makes you very visible to everybody else like look at me I have a mage

Speaker 3
does it give you the ability to cast press digitization press it's the zero level spell

Speaker 2
it's the white robe of the Arch Magi. Oh, you have a white robe of the Arch Magi? Yes, what does it do? I can press the digitate. Oh! 100%!

Speaker 1
Never fails.

Speaker 2
30% of the time, 100% of the time.

Speaker 3
Otherwise, I'll wear it just for that ability. To most wearers, the robe

Speaker 4
offers no powers and has no effects unless the wearer's alignment does not match the robe. Interesting.

Speaker 1
So what alignment is the robe?

Speaker 4
The robe is white, which is good alignment.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 4
To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of the robe. See below. An arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item's power once the robe is donned. Oh. Oh, okay, got it. So an arcane person can use the powers of the robe.

Speaker 1
Looks like he's drawing like one of those, that game where you have to try to flip the, the pipes to match the water and go through.

Speaker 4
You might have better luck with the wet erase markers just an FYI in the future.

Speaker 2
It's darker.

Speaker 4
I'm going to wear that robe.

Speaker 1
Well, at least I can find you in the dark.

Speaker 4
It's just white. I'm going to put that robe on, by the way.

Speaker 1
White reflects light.

Speaker 4
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2
Oh, you put it on?

Speaker 4
I'm going to put it on. You can finish what you do. I'm just letting you know.

Speaker 2
I've got to roll present on right now. Yeah, it seems to fit you.

Speaker 4
Does it seem to have the abilities that it would?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 4
Okay, cool.

Speaker 2
It seems like it's functioning properly.

Speaker 1
Try to impress the digitization and see what happens. I'm not falling fuck that

Speaker 2
so unlike all the rest of these cliffs that you've heard this cave structure that you did cave walls open up here coming down and around and you notice that there's a large oblong pit that just the cliff edge is there But these are solid rock walls. This outer edge is solid rock. This outer edge is solid rock. Here. Each one of these little lines represents another 10 foot hop down. As you come across, you pass the mushrooms and the bone dragon into this next walkway area.

Speaker 4
21. Give me one second, I just gotta make note of one of these buffs for the roll.

Speaker 2
I did not remember to look up what does the white coat of the Archmage I do?

Speaker 4
So if you're an arcane spellcaster that can realize that the power understands what it is what the robe is it's plus 5 armor bonus to your AC spell resistance of 18 plus 4 resistance bonus of all saving throws and a plus 2 enchantment bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance and stuff. Oh, nice. But if you didn't align with the... If you were chaotic and you wore the robe, it would be negative...

Speaker 2
Like a lawful robe?

Speaker 4
Or the evil... Good to evil. It's good to evil, sorry. So if you're evil... I figured there's probably one for sure. And it was a good aligned cloak robe, you'd suffer negative... You have permanent negative levels. Immediately you gain three permanent negative levels that you can't...

Speaker 2
Did you grab the orb of utter chaos?

Speaker 4
Yes. Yeah, we got it.

Speaker 2
Okay, who grabbed the Org of Outer Chaos?

Speaker 4
Well, first let me do a knowledge on it. It's a 10th level, so... I'm a little terrible again. 25? 25. Recognize it?

Speaker 2
The Org of Outer Chaos, yeah, you feel like it should not fall into Luthor's hands. It might be detrimental. And you definitely feel it should not fall into Max's hands. As that would change his alignment and make him not viable for his deity anymore. You feel like you could carry it just fine.

Speaker 4
I could have swore I had an orb like this because I remember having... There's an orb of weather control somewhere along the line. I'll look at my character sheet. I'll put it into the bag of holding.

Speaker 2
You feel like Luthor would be deterred from wanting to grab this, and you know Max would be in some serious hot water if he ever touched this thing. Now you have leverage. Hey Max, catch. Oh. I wish I was going to search all the sheets. What? Yeah, I put it in my wallet.

Speaker 4
Gem of brightness.

Speaker 2
Gem of brightness?

Speaker 4
Yeah, Gem of brightness.

Speaker 2
Is that your light source? Or is it just light? I'm just using the light right now.

Speaker 3
Be hilarious. Catch. Catch. Oh.

Speaker 2
Yeah, just toss it away.

Speaker 3
Okay. It's permanent as long as you hold it.

Speaker 2
Yep. Is it a minor artifact? Is it just a caster level?

Speaker 4
Wondrous item.

Speaker 2
It is wondrous? Okay. Because I would say as long as you are holding it, you're also getting the chaotic alignment. Your good evil doesn't change, but...

Speaker 4
He or bestows one negative level on any lawful creature holding or carrying it. It's essentially a dispel magic.

Speaker 3
It doesn't change your alignment.

Speaker 2
Oh, maybe not according to the book.

Speaker 3
This might be a modified.

Speaker 4
Very well. Depends what book you're looking in. The wizards that's created such wondrous items known to have a little bit of...

Speaker 2
I mean, I would assume that a lawful outsider would be... Ambiguity. ...extremely affected by this thing. At least more extremely than a human who just happens to be more lawful than they are chaotic. Right. And he has an aura of law, so... Because of his lawful neutral god of making things nice in cities. Who do you worship? I worship the city planner god. I worship red tape. The red tape. I like the bureaucracy. Did you feel out of form to like the bureaucracy? No. Have you notarized your form to like the bureaucracy? Notary. Alright, so you find yourself in this snaking pathway that still descends, but these descends are only 10 feet as opposed to 20 feet from earlier. They're just kind of half carved, half natural. Maybe they were maintained at one point in time. Bag of holding, take three. Alright, so I'm being pulled around into that... Yeah, not directly. It's taking you the pathway to get to this old bound thing.

Speaker 4
So we've got to go around into there.

Speaker 2
At least I think. That's what I'm guessing. The number of mushrooms are lessened. Everyone make a perception check as you come across this snake way. Snake way.

Speaker 1
36.

Speaker 4
32. 32.

Speaker 2
Tell me in 12 and a half seconds when I do this one thing. Okay. Do not cop down.

Speaker 4
12 and a half of my seconds. Thank you. We're going for DM time. Thank you. Four on all sides. That's nice. I like that. Yes. Yes. Pish. Pish. Pish Posh.

Speaker 2
Pish. Perfect. All right, so. Oh, damn. Okay, I'm going around the table. 49. 49.

Speaker 4
36.

Speaker 2
36. 32. 32. We all rolled really good. We can see shit.

Speaker 1
I'm 26 without rolling.

Speaker 2
I like us. We're a good group. 32, 36, 40 something.

Speaker 3
49. I had 31 without rolling.

Speaker 2
46? 49? 49.

Speaker 1
I'm 36.

Speaker 2
Okay. So all of you notice that these mushrooms are along this chamber. They're kind of clinging to the walls and you see where the moisture is. It's kind of where they're gathering. But around here, this bend, you see the mushrooms, but they're not glowing. Wait, where? around this curve of the walkway. There's still enough on either side to give that dim, lit glow, but in this section here you can visibly see the mushroom caps, the mushroom heads and things, but they're not glowing. Ileana, you notice across the way As Wazemans do. Much larger than this. A quadruped of a panther-like creature is there. Kind of hidden, but noticeable. Luther, you notice three additional ones all on this side.

Speaker 4
You said quadrupeds?

Speaker 2
Quadrupeds. Panther-like quadrupeds. Gizma, you did not notice any of the four of them.

Speaker 4
Really? Wow.

Speaker 2
They have really high stealth and darkness. That's awesome. What was your spot check?

Speaker 3
32.

Speaker 2
Yeah, you didn't notice anyone.

Speaker 3
Can I give a survival for what these are?

Speaker 2
Yes. Planes or religion. Ah, religion.

Speaker 3
17.

Speaker 2
17? Demon panthers.

Speaker 3
Of course they are.

Speaker 2
Shadow demon panthers.

Speaker 3
I point out the demon panthers that are sitting across the way from us. Are going into initiative.

Speaker 2
he says look and look and like two of them are like

Speaker 3
there's demon panthers

Speaker 2
that's a nice panther 12 o'clock 12 12 12 demon panthers at 12 o'clock I need a...

Speaker 3
And because, the rule is, I will go last.

Speaker 4
Do any of you like banana chips?

Speaker 1
Yes, I eat way too many of them.

Speaker 4
Do you like dark chocolate hummus?

Speaker 1
No, I don't like hummus, period.

Speaker 4
even chocolate.

Speaker 1
I've never had chocolate, but I don't like hummus, so...

Speaker 4
You want to try it? It doesn't taste like hummus.

Speaker 1
That's the last resident of Toby. I know.

Speaker 4
I've been burned before. He's like, I've got trauma here. I'd say try a banana chip in. It's just chocolate pudding. Think of it that way.

Speaker 1
Okay, chocolate pudding. If it's not chocolate pudding, you're in trouble.

Speaker 4
Listen, you made a choice. weird texture that's the hummus part it's the texture

Speaker 1
otherwise it's not horrible I probably wouldn't seek it out normally but it's not horrible

Speaker 2
that's over the sounding eh

Speaker 1
it's your healthy kick

Speaker 2
I meant your review was a sounding eh That's not horrible. On a scale of not great to terrible, it's probably better than that.

Speaker 4
Alright, initiatives? There's a lot of little markers out there.

Speaker 2
Well, I only had two large bases. Do you want more? Those are four large creatures.

Speaker 1
I think they're breeding it's their offspring.

Speaker 2
Going around the table.

Speaker 3
Uh, 15.

Speaker 1
17.

Speaker 2
What's your modifier? Your initiative modifier?

Speaker 1
I rolled an 8. My initiative is a 9.

Speaker 2
Seven? Oh, nine? Alright. Roll a d20, don't add anything to it. Five. Okay. And Casey? Twelve for me. Twelve.

Speaker 4
Here we go. Here's another large base. You don't have to move them all individually. Thank you. And if you need more large bases, you can't have them. Okay. No, you can't throw any large stuff at us anymore. Huge it is. It's because we don't have... Can I get into a basis? Yes.

Speaker 2
An elder dragon appears. Be careful what you wish for. You had 14? No, you had 15. I have 15.

Speaker 1
Am I the only one who matters again? God damn it.

Speaker 3
You matched what they have.

Speaker 1
And I roll like shit. Maybe I can hide and they wouldn't see me. I'm not wearing white. You two have light sources.

Speaker 4
Yep. Yes.

Speaker 1
And he's wearing white. Wanna put that out? He's wearing white.

Speaker 4
I'm pure.

Speaker 1
Purely in trouble.

Speaker 4
Whatever. Pure is the word.

Speaker 1
Where is this war? It smells like a washing machine.

Speaker 4
It does, yeah.

Speaker 2
And they start moving towards you aggressively.

Speaker 4
Lovingly? No, aggressively.

Speaker 2
Lovingly? You cuddly things? Ileana. Sure. They seem to have noticed light.

Speaker 1
I back away from them. I'd rather be in a shadow.

Speaker 4
Oh, I did take Kronk with me, by the way. I didn't leave him behind. Unless otherwise noted, I never leave him behind. I assumed that would be the case, but I didn't want to leave it up to GM's. ambiguity, so...

Speaker 2
You never said you took him.

Speaker 4
You guys left your familiars in the treasure room.

Speaker 2
I don't know. Are they guarding the treasure?

Speaker 4
Well, he's a fairy dragon, so he was rolling in things like a cat in catnip.

Speaker 2
Treasure hoard. Finally, I've made the big time dead.

Speaker 4
Keep in mind, he'll also roll in a pile of glitter if I get the same thing.

Speaker 1
Don't say that again.

Speaker 4
Alright. Who's up first? Ileana. Me.

Speaker 1
Moving away from the guys. So I'm out of their light source. And then I'm going to try shooting at the back one. Not the front one. Over the gorge unless it's too far. I don't know how far out it is. These are all the same letter. So I'm shooting for C.

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 3
first time in a long time they didn't move in a striking distance

Speaker 2
they uh the the two in front actually kind of just aggressively but they they moved at Like ones they didn't double move right so they they're kind of positioning themselves the two and back

Speaker 1
Definitely move their whole so going down the line just so I know 33 does that hit? Yes, 35 yes 22 no 30 yes

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 1
So then... Okay, got that. Is it evil?

Speaker 3
uh yes think about it could be just it could be natural they are they are demon panthers

Speaker 1
what are you doing no no what are you doing it's opening something it's not supposed to Okay. So... Does holy affect them?

Speaker 2
Uh, you're doing good? You're doing good damage? I think so. Is your... What kind of damage are you doing?

Speaker 1
Well, I can do 2d6 holy or elemental, and I picked holy. So if holy doesn't work, then that eliminates that.

Speaker 2
Well, I need to know all the damages that you're doing. Okay. But...

Speaker 1
So you're doing magic? Yep. Doing good damage? I guess. Holy damage is good. Holy damage is good damage. So yeah, but there's regular damage and then there's the holy damage separate. Do you want that separate?

Speaker 2
No. Okay. All right, then. The first two. If you choose elemental, I'll need to know elemental damage separate.

Speaker 1
No, I chose holy. Okay. If holy damage does nothing, then I won't add those in. If it does something, then I'll add those in.

Speaker 2
Holy does something, elemental does something different.

Speaker 1
Different, right. Okay, so I'm doing holy damage. Depending on the element. I opted for holy. Okay. So, the first two arrows hit for 33 each. Then 27 for 1, and then 30 for 1. Score. If I add that up.

Speaker 2
Is that C or E that you were shooting? C.

Speaker 1
For a total of 123.

Speaker 2
123? Yep.

Speaker 1
Sometimes you say you need to know information separate, so I was just making sure that you know what you need to know.

Speaker 2
a rather nasty chunk out of number C. Number letter. See? I was just thinking that. Now are

Speaker 1
they wide enough that they can't get past each other on the path? You can move past allies.

Speaker 2
Okay so they can get past... They are large cats so they're very nimble and able to... they would

Speaker 1
be able to weave their way past each other. All right so they're not as wide as the bases. They're

Speaker 2
imagine um slender but muscular okay just curious uh that makes it luther's turn

Speaker 3
um i didn't realize i gained my extra flurry this round two this level two now i'm up to seven uh Uh...

Speaker 2
As long as you don't sprint, you can go down the 10-foot drop without any issue. No, if you're sprinting it'll be an acrobatics check.

Speaker 3
I actually don't think I need to sprint.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean like a running sprinting. So like quadruple your movement. Other than that, anyone can just drop down pretty easily. This is not 20 feet, it's only 10. and they're 10 feet below uh yeah each each ledge is 10 foot okay lower roughly they're they're not carved steps but they're right no i got you i'm just semi rampish semi-cliffish 10 foot.

Speaker 4
He didn't mention the semi-deafish, so I think we're safe.

Speaker 2
Semi-rempish. Oh yeah, this area is immensely deeper. Mentally or infinitely? I mean, it stops eventually, I'm sure. Near infinite? When you toss a coin down and see how long it takes to make a noise.

Speaker 4
Like everybody, even the Panthers, are waiting. Their ears off.

Speaker 2
Was that it? No, I think that just hit the side of the wall, not the actual bottom. Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting. Bouncing back and forth as it still goes.

Speaker 4
Several days later, we see the coin come back up. Like it hit the other side of the earth. And the gravity pulled it back through again like a slingshot.

Speaker 2
When he hits the bottom and tremors thrown out from the center of this pit.

Speaker 4
That'd be an interesting damage to roll for whatever he's down there. 1D6 times how many thousands of feet? That coin is now bent. That brings in the question of the terminal velocity of things in this universe. They didn't design that mechanic.

Speaker 2
Actually, I kind of say once you hit once you fall more than 6 feet, you just take the amount of damage that you fall so it's no longer like 66 because it's weird to think like a you know 17th level character could jump out of a 120 story foot building and survive just doesn't make sense so after six feet you take whatever distance you fell as the damage no more d6s yeah i rolled minimum 66 while I fell and I only took 6 damage. No. Once you pass that 60 feet, you just take that. Which makes it a lot easier to calculate. We're 120 feet up and my maximum HP is 140, so I should be able to survive this. Well, fine, technically, yes, you're using my rules against me, but you take 120 points of damage. um he's doing a lot of thinking here

Speaker 3
I am because this is I normally don't get into the situation where I can't jump into a

Speaker 2
where you can't just flurry the fuck out of everything that moves

Speaker 3
yes this is rare for me

Speaker 4
were you paying attention when I when it was Tom and Vic Carlos or Shivers and Vic Carlos and he was wanted to know whether he was five foot in front of him five foot away. And I'm like, you just five foot step in and you do your flurry of blows. He's like, well, I need to know. And I'm like, I don't know why you're arguing this. You make the attack. He's like, well, it might be important later on, whether I was next to him or not. And I'm like, are you trying to bank a technicality to use against me later? It's like, who are you? Your thing happens.

Speaker 2
You kill the guy. What's the problem? You can five feet and flurry. Five explodes.

Speaker 4
Yeah. But was I next to him or not?

Speaker 3
Well, my issue is I need 40 feet to freaking flurry. And I'm out of 40 feet range.

Speaker 4
Wait, you can travel 40 feet and flurry?

Speaker 3
Jump attack, yes.

Speaker 4
Oh. That is super annoying. Not like your repose isn't super annoying, thank you very much. Every monster I throw at his little swashbuck, he's like, Perry, repose. Like, son of a bitch. This guy had a massive attack. I just got a meter beat it. Like, fuck. Would you roll on your dice?

Speaker 2
Does it matter? My armor is like 22, but then my attack roll is 14 plus my roll. So the trade-off is if I roll 2, my AC is now 16 instead of 22.

Speaker 3
But this indeed is 10 feet across?

Speaker 2
Yes. But you're going to want to make an acrobatic attack because that is... That's where an AC makes the drop spindle. A far way to fall.

Speaker 3
No, no, that's fine.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
I have the movement and the jump to do it. That's my least. That's not what I'm worried about.

Speaker 2
I think this is most movement.

Speaker 3
I had to. This is. So we will end up here.

Speaker 2
Attack of opportunity. If you don't stop at the edge, you will get an attack of opportunity, depending on your acrobatic check.

Speaker 3
Yeah, my acrobatics is going to be...

Speaker 1
I already shot it a bunch, so...

Speaker 2
Yeah, this one's hurting. But you didn't do as much damage as you thought you did.

Speaker 1
I did plenty. You did plenty. 23 is plenty.

Speaker 2
You did plenty of damage. But it seemed to have resisted some of the attack. You're like, huh, he shook that off really well.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 2
Most people don't. Yeah, this is where... Most people have a lot more pain in their bodies when I do that to them.

Speaker 3
So this is my hope how everything will work. Okay. Because I... So I'm using... I will end up using... Spring attack? Not spring attack. God damn it. What was that? I have the move attack ability as well. Spring attack? I think it is spring attack. So if I have to move, I'll decide that. So yeah, I'm just going to hit him.

Speaker 2
Roll your acrobatics. I don't want to fall down a cliff. Not a problem. Also, we'll see if he gets an attack of opportunity.

Speaker 3
I am upwards of 30.

Speaker 2
First is what there's CMD.

Speaker 1
Where's our CMD?

Speaker 3
Oh. skills skills uh i am at 37 okay no tech like i said it's hard for me to fail these anymore that's all right well 37 versus his cnd

Speaker 4
is actually a lot closer than you think it's commendable you don't play him like an op character even though he's OP. And also, most people like min-max that crap out of that. It's nice that you play a little more casual. Like, eh, I know I could do some pretty cool shit, but...

Speaker 2
So you easily jump the 10-footy. And this panther, like, wasn't expecting you to come through over the cliff, so it was caught off guard as it, like, wasn't ready to swipe at you as you jumped past.

Speaker 4
It was like... You grab him in the tail.

Speaker 2
I got your tail! So, uh... If you had come out on an honorable path, it probably would have gotten you with that...

Speaker 3
Who's the pretty kitty? Okay, because this is going to be something I've not done yet, so I have to look at the...

Speaker 4
It's like Fantastic Beasts, he pulls out the little cat toy and jingles it a little bit. Right.

Speaker 2
Um, who has a bag of catnapper? Oh!

Speaker 3
Who's the pretty kitty? I'm actually going to go out on a line and try to use a stunning fist on them.

Speaker 2
Okay. So, I'll let you know something that happens when you get to about here. Your light source goes out. Huh. That sucks. And it remains out for the entire movement.

Speaker 4
So, this is just a jump of faith. Leap, if you will. Right? Very Indiana Jones.

Speaker 3
Did it turn back on or no?

Speaker 2
No, it's still out.

Speaker 4
huh do we do i'm assuming we see this too yes um he's he's moving all and then all of a sudden

Speaker 2
it's everything's dim around him so like the the torch or the the flashlight that he had on his

Speaker 3
head no my chest it's my uh um it just it just stopped thing it ran over batteries it's right next to your body cam it's essentially it's like a body cam

Speaker 2
it wasn't like a flicker flicker out it was just interesting the the batteries weren't drained they're just not there i find that fascinating

Speaker 1
um It's freezing in here, but it's warmer in here. It's funny. I'm just freezing. I thought I came prepared. Next time. Blink it.

Speaker 3
I really should learn the rules of stuff that I've never used before.

Speaker 1
Like what?

Speaker 4
You know, we should always be rich when we don't have money. Right? That's what that statement meant to me. He's like, things that I don't use, I should really learn them. Why? You don't use them.

Speaker 3
Because it's part of my thing. So, okay, blah, blah, blah. I'm going to decide to use attack roll. That's fine. Okay, so they have a... So there will be a fortitude save of 17.

Speaker 2
He didn't disappear, though, right? No, the light source went out.

Speaker 4
That's okay.

Speaker 2
You can still kind of see him in the darkness. You can see him fine because he had low light vision. But if you were to attack Luthor right now, he'd have a 20% mischamp.

Speaker 1
So did you turn it off or did it go off on its own?

Speaker 2
It went off on its own. Oh, you don't have that 20% chance to do a low light vision. Your attack has a 20% chance to miss.

Speaker 3
Okay. Well, I definitely hit him, so... 20%. So it's over 20?

Speaker 2
Yeah. I believe you have blind fight so if it's under 20 you re-roll

Speaker 3
once. Okay good because I rolled a 19 You do have blind fight I do have blind fight 59 and I hit him with a 40 something

Speaker 2
Oh yeah you hit him

Speaker 3
So he has to make a save

Speaker 2
Roll your damage And then I'll see if he needs to roll a save

Speaker 1
because the one I already hit so

Speaker 2
oh uh he may or may not need to make a save oh of course I'm used to your flurry so maybe this maybe he will have to make a save

Speaker 3
6 18 I'm doing holy damage hitting with I'm using a whole, admantine, cold iron.

Speaker 1
You make a concoction to fist things? Yes, essentially. Cool.

Speaker 3
I'm going to not roll it. 6, 18, 19, 20, 21. 21.

Speaker 2
I'm so used to you having hundreds of damage.

Speaker 3
This is what happens when I get to hit it once. roll kind of low.

Speaker 2
All right. So you like jump over this thing and you're like, ha ha, as you're like flying past, you do this weird twist in the air and like punch him in the skull before landing. And it takes the damage on the chin and it's like, and it just kind of shakes its head. And you realize, make a sense of it. It liked it a lot. It's masochistic?

Speaker 3
Oh. Oh. 38.

Speaker 2
The stunning didn't matter. Like, most living creatures would have reacted to getting hit in the jaw like that. Like, they would, you know, the way their neck would have jerked, it should have, like, stunned them and stuff. But, like, this one, it just doesn't have that effect.

Speaker 1
It's like a stuffed one around the wheels.

Speaker 2
Like, it's neck twisted, like you hit it and such, but, like, it just shakes its head back into place.

Speaker 3
So is it that it doesn't take

Speaker 2
level or things? It doesn't seem that stunning works on this creature.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 2
The way you hit it should have caused a living creature to react with some kind of damage to the brain. Or is this one just kind of twisted its head back into place?

Speaker 3
No, because I was going to blind him. That was my goal.

Speaker 2
Oh, I thought you were stoning Fism.

Speaker 3
So at level 16, I have the ability to... Oh. Fatigue, sicken, staggered, or blind.

Speaker 2
Oh. Then I guess...

Speaker 3
And if he fails it, he's blind permanently.

Speaker 2
So I described that same thing, but you take the hit in the eye instead of in the jaw. And it closes its eye for a second, and then it's with a weird unnatural... It reopens its eyes.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 2
And they kind of, like, bobs its head, and the eyeballs roll back into place where they should be.

Speaker 1
They're macacons?

Speaker 2
They're definitely super deep into panthers now. Like, you thought they were demon panthers before? These things are fucking demon, demon panthers. Because the way it just, like, you push the eyeball back towards its skull, and it just kind of like bobbed its head to get it back into place.

Speaker 3
And that's why I never use these abilities. Because they never work.

Speaker 2
Because some things are immune to certain things. They never work. It does look even closer to being on its last legs than before.

Speaker 3
I don't use them because at lower levels, everybody can beat the frickin' difficulty for the save.

Speaker 2
higher level certain things are immune to certain things um so this the edge where these mushrooms are no longer glowing starts expanding there are now like 20 feet beyond where it originally was now those mushrooms aren't glowing as well Luthermic perception 34 34 There's Two things moving in that pit And they're getting closer

Speaker 1
Something that kills things

Speaker 2
That's why I'm happy I stayed away from the edge of the pit It's They're but in a different way than these panthers are. Yzma. 20 feet of mushrooms started going out closer towards where you're positioned and also further from where you're positioned.

Speaker 4
Okay, I'm going to do knowledge arcana. I think I have a good idea of what this is. Oh, I already rolled it. It was... I already rolled it. I already rolled it again. It was... A 30. It was a 9 plus 21. Do I know... Searching my memory. This is like a darkness, maybe, or a deeper darkness, or a greater darkness. It has to be.

Speaker 2
Deeper darkness would cause complete darkness. This is just dimming the lights. It's going down to dim light. So maybe like an aura of shadows where it would lower the amount of light but not necessarily block the light. But you also piece together that it started coming at you after the Panthers had moved.

Speaker 4
So it's probably on one of them.

Speaker 2
The Panthers moved, and then a couple seconds later, then the darkness started spreading.

Speaker 4
Okay, so something's on one of them, maybe, potentially.

Speaker 2
Like a darkness spell would move with them, or an aura of theirs would move with them. so like if it is an aura it's not coming from these panthers so you figure either something that can create or cause darkness is getting closer to you guys not darkness but dimming of like light suction like a vacuum of light is coming closer to you guys

Speaker 3
there's something

Speaker 2
there's something coming out of the pit

Speaker 4
there's something coming out of the pit

Speaker 2
yes you like punch this panther in the eyeball and you're like there's something coming out of the pit guys

Speaker 4
alright uh based on what he said uh invisibility and I look over at you and I say be right back and pop into invisibility I tried to do that too

Speaker 3
It didn't work

Speaker 2
You just say I'll be right back I'll be right back guys Did it work? Did what work? Oh

Speaker 4
Did it not? Did it become invisible or not? Oh yeah I don't know

Speaker 3
I'll be right back too guys No I was trying to become invisible by poking out his eye

Speaker 4
I'm invisible If I'm not visible That's... I like that. That's the most strictest definition. If he can't see me, I am by all means invisible.

Speaker 2
Did you make a knowledge religion or planes on these cats?

Speaker 4
No, but I could. These cool cats. If you feel that I would have been like, huh, I saw that from somewhere.

Speaker 2
It is your turn if you have knowledge planes or religion.

Speaker 4
Hey, they're both the same, so you know what? I rolled a 1 plus 3 so if it's failable yes otherwise it's a 4

Speaker 2
Luther's right these are definitely demon cats

Speaker 4
I knew it I knew he's right I've never seen one before but I think you're right I've never even heard of one but now I have going forward every cat that looks anything like this

Speaker 2
any cat that looks shadowy and panther like it must be a demon cat now that my knowledge has been seared into my brain on this one. Do you do anything else? Move?

Speaker 4
No. I'm going to stay here. Just because I'm assuming this darkness is creeping in, right? Yeah. So it was here.

Speaker 2
One, two, three, four. Now it's like at the edge of this cliff here.

Speaker 4
I'm so fascinated by the effect that I'm not putting two and two together that something's coming out of the pit.

Speaker 2
So, like, these mushrooms were all out, and then all of a sudden, like, Like that one scene with the hallway where the one light goes up

Speaker 3
up to this point here. It was like... In exactly five foot increments. In exactly...

Speaker 4
In the way it would take someone to climb at quarter their speed. Right. It's interesting. Like pixelated too. It's right here, and all of a sudden it's there, and all of a sudden it's there.

Speaker 2
It's like all of them in this five-foot square just go out simultaneously.

Speaker 4
And it's not rounded either. It's not like a soft edge. It's like perfectly blocky.

Speaker 2
That's interesting. There's actually a mushroom that's in between the two eyes. It's like half of it goes out. The other half still goes.

Speaker 4
Like perfectly lit.

Speaker 2
Um. I'm going to need a reflex save from both of you two. Who's two? Me two? You two. You two, too.

Speaker 1
Play with people.

Speaker 4
Not a problem, but I don't know for sure.

Speaker 1
I was going to roll my racer like that. That's going to help. Holy shit, I had a 1. The good old racer die.

Speaker 3
You get pluses because you're roped now. You get pluses because you're roped now.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I got that built in.

Speaker 1
38. 38?

Speaker 4
19.

Speaker 1
19.

Speaker 4
I did roll a 1, so that may not be a fail.

Speaker 2
Both of you take half of this. Do you know how much that I tell you in just a second?

Speaker 3
Invest in improved evasion. Improved what? Improved evasion. Because when you take half, you take nothing. And when you take...

Speaker 1
Half of half?

Speaker 3
No, you take... Anytime it says you take half, if you succeed, you don't take anything. It's the only reason that dragon didn't fucking hit me.

Speaker 2
Take 20 points of cold damage each. Oh, damn. And that was the half, so don't half that. Uther, we'll need two reflex saves from you.

Speaker 3
One probably failed.

Speaker 2
And you have improved evasion or just a... I have improved evasion. Okay, so you'll take half damage from this one and no damage from the other one. Assuming that you passed the second one. Uh... I'm pretty sure...

Speaker 3
I passed this. I'm pretty sure I passed one of them because I have over 25. Duplex! 30! And 15. Or 30 and 17.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
I'm sitting here.

Speaker 2
Take 12 points of cold damage. And you avoid the other one. As all these creatures start going when blasting out a cone of cold from their mouths. And then C is just gonna full attack you. The cold doesn't seem to affect any of the Panthers in this line as they blast you. Chin.

Speaker 4
Was this something that came out of the pit or was these Panthers that did this?

Speaker 2
The Panthers mouth.

Speaker 4
Oh, that one's near us. That's why that... okay.

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 4
Burst of...

Speaker 3
Um... What's your reason? Uh... Uh... 32. 32? Nobody puts loot there in a corner.

Speaker 1
And... Of course not. We make him fight all the big stuff. Only because I don't want to become your friend in this round yet. I have a system yet because you're like, "Why'd you just be my best friend?" It would be great.

Speaker 2
Take, uh, 16 points of damage.

Speaker 1
Roll me a fortitude save.

Speaker 3
22. 22.

Speaker 2
Alright. This thing tries to claw and bite at you, but it only lands one of its... one of its... not... what's the forward part of the cat? Claw? Hind... No, the other...

Speaker 1
Foreclaw?

Speaker 2
Foreclaw, sure. The front claw catches you. And as it cuts into you, your vision kind of blurs for a second, but then you're like, no.

Speaker 3
shake it off. Oh, you were going to try to blame me. Ironically. He was also trying to go invisible.

Speaker 2
It's Illyana's name.

Speaker 1
Great, but it's Illyana, not Illyana. You keep calling me Illyana. I don't belong to the X-Men, so Do I have your name wrong this entire time? It's Liana. L-I-A-N-A.

Speaker 2
Well, I wrote down your initiative as Illyana. So now you're a next man.

Speaker 3
Now you get a pet dragon. Right?

Speaker 2
Actually, Yzma

Speaker 1
does have a pet dragon. Well, because you're doing cold damage, I'm going to try for Electrical instead of Holy. So I'm hitting the one in front of me because he's obviously in front of me. 40 hit?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 1
43 hit?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 1
30 hit?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 1
32 hit?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 1
And I hit with all my arrows.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
Do you need to know the electrical is separate?

Speaker 2
The electrical damage?

Speaker 1
Yeah, I just had an electrical. This time it's hard.

Speaker 2
No. You can add it all together.

Speaker 1
Okay, then all together I hit with 152 points of damage.

Speaker 2
152.

Speaker 1
I messed up my stuff ahead of time, so I wouldn't be taking up too much time. What number is that, B?

Speaker 2
Ah, yes, the good old number B. And that electrical damage just does jolt it pretty good.

Speaker 1
Visible jolts.

Speaker 2
It seems to react unkindly to the electrical.

Speaker 1
Good. I don't want to be kind.

Speaker 2
well I said unkindly um who's after Luzer

Speaker 3
um so oh wait I already did my thing that's right I'm

Speaker 2
it kind of looks like it's on it's last legs be there now that uh now that it just took four arrows to the face

Speaker 3
so I am going to

Speaker 2
you actually think to yourself like that should have put it down but like it's still standing apparently might have resisted some of that damage.

Speaker 3
Alright, so I'm going to go through, start at C, hit it twice. I will be then to E, hit it twice, and then go to D and hit it twice.

Speaker 2
Okay. Can you roll one acrobatics just to weave your way through these panthers?

Speaker 3
Jab style, I don't take attacks of opportunity at all in this. Okay, never mind. That's the jet.

Speaker 2
I was actually, and I actually meant to like squeeze, you know, because there is a sheer drop on one side of these creatures.

Speaker 3
Sure.

Speaker 2
In that respect,

Speaker 3
sure. Which, but I thought it was for...

Speaker 2
Actually, if you had the ability to push any of these creatures, could be used to your advantage. But I don't know if you do. And also, you probably can flurry and push something.

Speaker 3
No.

Speaker 2
You hit him the right way, So when they back up...

Speaker 3
There are certain abilities that you can do, but I am not using them with this.

Speaker 4
Give us a full round action of flurry.

Speaker 2
So it's 2, 2, and 2, you said? 2, 2, and 3.

Speaker 3
2, 2, and 3. 2 is getting a shattering punch.

Speaker 2
Oh, so you're straight up murdering this one in one pit, huh?

Speaker 3
This one, well no, this one's going to get the shattering punch, which that blows through any... Two, okay, got it. Yeah, E. E is getting a shattering punch, so one of the hits that I do will, no matter what his resistance is, is going to go through for everything. So I will give him that damage separately.

Speaker 2
You don't have to. Your damage is alright.

Speaker 3
Okay. So first one, first one I hit twice. 18.

Speaker 2
The first one you put down. Okay. As you, I assume you can do at least 25 points of damage between two hits.

Speaker 3
I did that.

Speaker 2
Okay. The first one falls pretty significantly. Okay, second one. Both at full attack.

Speaker 3
Potential crit. I hit, he gets one crit, one hit. And that's E? That's E. So...

Speaker 2
You're invisible. Was your light source on you?

Speaker 4
It was casted on something I was wearing.

Speaker 2
You were wearing? Yeah. Well, you don't notice because you have a light vision. The light goes out, essentially. Not for you, because it's your light and your invisible. So your invisible light... I don't know how this would work.

Speaker 4
The question is, does it cast light? Do I see the reflection of light off things?

Speaker 2
You can see it as if you still have the light source going. Everyone else doesn't see the light source. that's how I'm wondering about that

Speaker 4
but they still see the effect of the light on like things that it shines off of right so like I can see these lights because I can see a halo in light but I can also see the things because the light is shining off it in this case I'm assuming the light is now invisible so nobody can see the light source but they can still see the light

Speaker 2
as it penetrates things right I mean not that it matters to you you have low light vision but the light source hasn't gone out around you

Speaker 1
So I know she's still around.

Speaker 2
Yes. The things... It's hard for you to tell because your eyes automatically adjust to whether it needs low light vision or light vision. So you're like... Like, just kind of... When you first put on a pair of glasses, like that's how long it takes for your eyes to... Like, lower your glasses or raise your glasses. Like, just that moment of recorrecting. No, no, no. I mean, like, that's how long it takes to re-correct. All right.

Speaker 3
E takes 89 points of damage. E? Yep.

Speaker 2
89.

Speaker 3
So, last one is going to be...

Speaker 2
Who did we eliminate? C?

Speaker 3
Uh, yes. Oh, 89.

Speaker 1
Ah, I should have a higher, but that's okay.

Speaker 3
Actually, I can do four attacks on the last one. Last one's probably not going to hit though. Okay. Last attack, so probably not going to hit. Damn. So, 12. Thanks for it. Excuse me. 17. It's 40. Does the 28 hit?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 3
Okay. And 12, 15, 20, 25 hit? No. Okay. So he'll take three hits.

Speaker 2
Oh, there's a positive.

Speaker 4
I think it would be safe to say that these are vulnerable to hot if they are cold-based demons

Speaker 2
From what you know about demons, though, they might resist... Oh, no, demons resist acid. Not hot. Devils resist hot.

Speaker 4
They're not demons, though. They're demons. Yeah, they're demons. I was dealt this by very wise...

Speaker 2
Acid is the least likely to work against demons. You do know that. And whatever you conclude from their icy breaths. I'm literally filling in my internal book of knowledge of the planes

Speaker 4
based on what he's telling me.

Speaker 2
Demons are actually immune to acid.

Speaker 4
In fact, the only reason I have a rank, a single rank in that is because of all the knowledge that Luther's been imparting on me. I believe now that I got that one skill out of that, it's like, huh, that's a demon also.

Speaker 2
That's a demon. They don't like acid. I never tell you anything about acid. It's like, well, yeah, but this book said that they don't like acid. And you told me that was a demon, and I believe you. You know a lot more than I do. And the guy's like, they're demons. I'll start researching demons then. Oh, they don't like acid. Hey, Luther. I started going to devils first, and I'm like, oh, demon, I guess. Did you know that demons are immune to acid? They're like, they are. No wonder my acid system has been working.

Speaker 4
This is just a deep tissue massage to them. D took exactly 100 points an image.

Speaker 2
Oh, wow. Exactly 100.

Speaker 4
Nice job.

Speaker 2
Nice and easy. Thank you. Oh, who's after Luther? Oh, so these creatures that are in this pit. start climbing out and they don't really like climb out like they were climbing they just like walk on the air until they're like on solid ground and these guys are large they look like black suits of armor surrounded by like this shadowy aura knowledge

Speaker 3
definitely demons

Speaker 2
anyone who can see them Demon armor. That's a question. Demon armor. What knowledges do you all have?

Speaker 1
Planes, arcana.

Speaker 3
Religion.

Speaker 2
Local isn't going to help anything. Okay, you have it. Arcana, nobility, religion. Give me some arcana checks.

Speaker 4
Did you want to determine whether we see it or not?

Speaker 2
They're not hard to miss. I mean, one's directly across from you. There's dim light around. them, but they have like waves of shadow. I only got a 12. 30. 30? Um, these are shadow golems. Shadow golems. They're commonly known to be uh, golem servants of the nobles of Ned, Needle. The neighboring necromatic country that is either Nidel or Nidel. And I can't remember what I've been calling it this whole campaign.

Speaker 1
Nidel.

Speaker 2
Nidel. N-I-D-E-L. Is the shadow worshiping nation of necromancers. Not a demon. Not frequently used outside of Nidel. So it's weird that they'd be here in Chelix. You said 39? 30. 30. It's a basic understanding of them. Very basic. Yes. Well, no. You could get their CR by quite a bit, actually. So, they must be on loan, you would start to assume, because nobles of Nidale don't have much interest here in Quintargo, as far as you know. You do know, Like most constructs, they resist magic pretty good. What is their weakness besides? They are immune to cold. They resist any magic that has an SR. Okay. Spell resistance check. They resist it, meaning have a spell resistance? They automatically overcome anything that has a spell resistance skill. Oh, they have penetration then? No, they have spell resistance. If the spell has spell resistance that you have to roll, they pass it. Got it. Infinite spell resistance. That makes sense. Like most golems do. They are hardy. They resist physical attacks with the exception of adamantine slashing weapons. Slashing weapons.

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Speaker 2
So, um... And actually right behind you Max with his adamantine axe is still frozen in place in cardboard form. Figures. They do have a light or a shadow based breath weapon. And 30 you said?

Speaker 4
30.

Speaker 2
The spells that do start to affect them are any spell with the light or dark descriptors. can suppress its aura. No. In the parentheses, there's... My level zero light spell? Light! It can suppress their shadow aura for a round. Shadow conjuration and shadow evocation spells affect them as if they were... would reactivate their aura. and grant them fast healing.

Speaker 4
Wait, wait. So me casting greater shadow evocation on them is a bad thing? That's what I'm hearing you say.

Speaker 2
Unless you want to give them fast healing. Yeah, okay. Sunbeam and sunburst, on the other hand, they are considered susceptible to sunlight damage for those spells. So you'd be rolling d8s instead of d6s. And that can actually suppress its shadow aura. And Searing Light spell doesn't damage it, but it has the effect of a slow spell on it with no save.

Speaker 4
That's okay. We'll make it work.

Speaker 2
They also have a shadow aura, which absorbs light down to dim light within 60 feet of themselves. And now you're thinking about those mushrooms, and you're like, oh, yeah, 60 feet.

Speaker 4
it's going to be hard to find spells that don't have spell resistance

Speaker 2
yes that's why golems are the most dangerous things to a wizard who is also the person most

Speaker 3
likely to create one so recently i guess they somebody created the uh or at least it was recently put here just the iron iron cleric who is all about the constructs like so turning constructs and destroying constructs they can't do anything against undead all their channels all their channels affect on a golem golems and and just constructs that's actually a neat Neat idea for a class in somewhere.

Speaker 2
That feels like an artificer. It's like an anti-artificer room. Like an anti-artificer. Your creations are go against the way of nature. Like a nature cleric feels like they could get some mileage out of that one. You unnatural being. Of course then you give up the undead, which is also an unnatural being. Right. Use my, it's your turn. as these golems clamber out of... They don't really clamber, actually, given their size and their fact that they actually look like just black suits of armor. They don't actually make a lot of noise.

Speaker 1
They lumber.

Speaker 2
No, they have... Like, they move surprisingly well, considering, like, what you'd expect a suit of black armor to move like. Don't think that.

Speaker 1
So it's like Hogwarts Legacy. God. How high can they jump in the air?

Speaker 2
Well, they just came up from this pitfall. They can airwalk. So.

Speaker 4
Alright.

Speaker 2
They were walking on the air until they were not walking on the air.

Speaker 4
First things first. We're going to do our breath weapon at this guy, this panther, this demon panther.

Speaker 2
Oh, breath weapon.

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Speaker 2
That's a reflex for him?

Speaker 4
Reflex, DC, 17. I think it's half damage for...

Speaker 2
I'm just seeing if he has a bait or not. Click it.

Speaker 4
When in doubt, strike it out.

Speaker 2
Reflex, what's the DC?

Speaker 4
17.

Speaker 2
17?

Speaker 4
Yeah, it's half damage, I believe.

Speaker 2
Alright, half damage. What kind of energy?

Speaker 4
It's a flame. Fire. Okay. A-Z. 23 points of fire damage. That's not halved.

Speaker 2
23?

Speaker 4
12. Divide by 2, round up, right? Or is it round down? It would be 11 if it was round down.

Speaker 2
I think the default is round down, but I don't care.

Speaker 4
And I am...

Speaker 2
23 fire damage.

Speaker 4
23 fire damage, yes.

Speaker 2
12 plus... Okay.

Speaker 4
Not plus fire damage, it's a breath weapon of fire.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean the damage is fire type. Why can't I do math? There we are. So it actually bursts into flames as you hit it with this fire damage. And it goes... and it seems to be extra affected by the fire as like this fire clings to it. Not like its fur is not on fire, but it's like like a tar almost, and it's like stuck, the flames are stuck within the shadow creature's being. And it is, it seems not like you at all

Speaker 4
very much anymore. Now that I'm

Speaker 2
visible again. Not that you're visible again.

Speaker 1
Are you?

Speaker 4
Yes.

Speaker 2
Um.

Speaker 4
It was basic invisibility. So anyway, have some thoughts. Oh, I do start yelling out the shadow golems. Shadow golems! Shadow golems! What the fuck is that? Hit them with light shit. Atementine. Blades, of course. Not thumping. Electric?

Speaker 2
Electric, maybe. So this flame on this cat that's stuck to it like tar like burning tar it doesn't actually produce more light. So the flames are like clearly there but it's like dim flames like enveloping this cat all over. Like the ember of a campfire going out? Well no. It's blazing but it's like not producing light.

Speaker 1
And actually, oh, they absorb the light.

Speaker 2
Starts running away in panic from what it's afraid of.

Speaker 4
I don't think they do.

Speaker 2
I think the area is. And removes itself off of the edge of the cliff there as it flees at full speed from the fires. It's like, you know what, bad idea. You guys are obviously allowed to be here. And it full on failed that will save that I made it. and it runs from the source of the flame, which was the sudden human that appeared.

Speaker 1
What do I want to hit these things with?

Speaker 2
You just saw this cone of fire burst out and hit this cat, and it panicked and ended up running off the cliff in response. And then Yzma was right where the source of the flame started. The other two...

Speaker 1
uh also take hint and run leaving us only with two shadow no i'm gonna pull i'm gonna pull

Speaker 2
a luther oh no make that acrobatics check

Speaker 1
fire

Speaker 2
it happened to get into the exact same spot where that fire was hit that you sure you want to do that dude you sure that's the move you want to make no it has an ability

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
It's gonna move, double move, and pounce.

Speaker 1
Can you turn me around so I'm at least facing these people? Not like...

Speaker 2
Oh, you'll be facing it. In hell! Uh, what's your AC, Liana?

Speaker 1
It is 27.

Speaker 2
27, okay.

Speaker 3
So there's 10 rounds a minute? Um, yes. Okay.

Speaker 2
Sorry, the math wasn't working for a second.

Speaker 3
I was just making sure. 60 makes sense.

Speaker 2
So it bites into you and claws into you. And then there's that little 10 foot ledge and his second claw is coming at you and it just smashes its arm against that ledge and throws off the trajectory. But it does bite and claw you once.

Speaker 1
How much damage?

Speaker 2
Don't worry, you'll find out.

Speaker 1
No shit!

Speaker 2
When I finish rolling.

Speaker 1
I'm gonna imagine this isn't gonna feel really great. Just thoughts.

Speaker 2
Do you want the total damage? Or do you have any form of reductions?

Speaker 1
I don't think so. Just do total. I don't think I have any reductions, I don't think.

Speaker 3
Somewhere, I took the skill of elemental fury, which I didn't know. I should pay attention when I take from here on out. Which element? Fire.

Speaker 2
Oh, well there we go. Right? Take 33 points of damage. Note to self, I have this. They give me two fortitude saves.

Speaker 3
I could have started with it. Hold on one second please. I could have led the entire attacks, all my other attacks with that.

Speaker 1
I could do math. Fire damage for you. Fire damage for you.

Speaker 3
And I can flurry with it. And each attack has added fire damage. And the best part is it's going to show off by me just going like this. And my fist pointing and just bursting into flames. Because it doesn't say it does it.

Speaker 1
23. You said two of them?

Speaker 3
Yep. 17. I made this choice and it cannot be changed.

Speaker 2
Your vision starts closing in on you. And you are staggered. Which means you only get an action or a move next round. As your vision starts tunneling in.

Speaker 1
All I want to do is shoot. Can I shoot? Because I want to shoot. It is your turn. Okay. Now.

Speaker 3
You skipped me.

Speaker 2
Didn't you just flurry those two cats? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 3
No, you skipped me. Because you moved that cat. I've shot twice. You moved this cat. Oh, I was hitting you with the cat. You missed me. You forgot me.

Speaker 2
Thanks for reminding me that I've got to stab you with kitty claws. Or try to. What is your AC?

Speaker 3
32.

Speaker 2
32. So that one's not going to hit. That one's not going to hit. That one. And it's not going to crit. So it bites into you, but it's claws. It's just not very good with claws, apparently. But it does bite into you. And you kind of rolled with the bite, because that could have been a good chunkier liver that it just ripped off.

Speaker 1
Ow, my liver, my liver.

Speaker 2
My liver. Take 23 points of damage. Which, you avoided that real hard double damage there. Now, it is a Leon's turn. No trigger.

Speaker 1
Okay. I'm just going to shoot.

Speaker 2
You're in melee.

Speaker 1
So, the first one I shot...

Speaker 2
You're in melee.

Speaker 1
What do you mean melee?

Speaker 2
It means it's going to bite your face if you try and make an arranged attack. Right now.

Speaker 1
God damn it.

Speaker 2
It wants to bite your face.

Speaker 1
I can do one or the other. I can move or I can act.

Speaker 3
She's staggered. Yeah, but does 5-foot counters move? She'll be in melee. If she moves back by feet?

Speaker 2
Yep. Hold on. These things have tempo. With her claws. Not with her bite.

Speaker 1
Alright, I cast Fleming Spear.

Speaker 2
Okay, you're in melee.

Speaker 1
I'm as close as I'm going to get.

Speaker 2
I'm going to have to make a concentration check to avoid the attack of opportunity. or fight the attack of opportunity and then cast it.

Speaker 1
I don't have a choice. I don't have another weapon with me at the moment.

Speaker 2
Right.

Speaker 1
So.

Speaker 2
So.

Speaker 1
And I highly doubt poking it in the eyeball is going to do anything.

Speaker 2
So you're going to want to roll a level. Caster level check.

Speaker 3
Well, you have point blank shot. So changing all your weapons or casting a spell will deal less damage than what you're going to do. And you're going to provoke either which way.

Speaker 2
So, well, if you concentrate on your spell, you can avoid the attack of opportunity. So to concentrate, you just roll a dice plus your level and your, are you an intelligence-based caster? So your level and your int modifier on a d20. And the DC is 15 plus double the spell level. So whatever, what spell level is it? Second level spell? Third level spell?

Speaker 1
Um. Where is it? I just lost the damn spell. Where the hell did it go? Flaming Spade? Yeah, here it is. It's a level 2, yeah.

Speaker 2
Okay, so DC's gonna be 19. So. So your level plus your modifier plus a d20 to get higher than 19.

Speaker 1
19 or higher. So my level for being a wizard is only 2. Because I'm not...

Speaker 3
Caster level. Your caster level is...

Speaker 1
So caster level 10 plus my intelligence modifier which is 5. So it's 15.

Speaker 2
15 plus your roll. Do you have a spell penetrant combat casting? The feet. I don't think so. Combat casting gives you a plus four on that check.

Speaker 1
20. 20 on the deck. 20 on the deck.

Speaker 2
Perfectly fine. 35. The DC was 19.

Speaker 4
That was a concentration?

Speaker 2
Yep. So you start weaving your magic and you're watching this creature's movements so that you don't get close enough to it to allow it to take a chunk out of you as you're casting.

Speaker 1
It's just 3d6 fire damage so...

Speaker 2
Does it get any save? Or... Ummm... Here... Here... There's a nice tackle.

Speaker 1
Save and throw, reflex, negates.

Speaker 2
Okay, so what's the DC? Ummm... spell level so 10 plus 2 plus your inch modifier.

Speaker 1
My closest modifier is 5.

Speaker 2
10 plus 2 so 17. Do I have to roll that? No. That's what I have to beat with the reflex. As you conjure this flame it jumps off to the side fairly quickly. I saw what happened to that other guy. So it misses him? Yeah. But the flame spirit is still there and you can control it with a move action every round. As long as you don't cast another spell. You're level 10 for your casting.

Speaker 1
66 what?

Speaker 2
You're level 10 for your casting. Yeah, so you have 10 rounds of that. Yeah, so you can move it around as a move action for 10 more rounds.

Speaker 1
So it'll at least be between me and a half?

Speaker 2
This fire appears, but like... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. But it casts no light. I mean, it doesn't brighten up the area.

Speaker 1
Gotcha.

Speaker 2
But it's there. It's very clearly there. And you're just like, why isn't it? Like, a campfire that doesn't make any light. But the cat is definitely not keen at being this close to it. Who's after? Who's there?

Speaker 3
So I will spend a key point, bust my fists into flames. And it goes out 100 feet plus 10 feet per level. Yes, I will be able to. Actually, hold on.

Speaker 1
100 feet plus 10 feet plus per level. So it makes it 200 feet out for me. right?

Speaker 2
It should say how fast you can move the fire.

Speaker 1
It doesn't say how fast you can move it.

Speaker 2
Per round?

Speaker 3
It's got to give you a range.

Speaker 1
Burning glow of fire rolls in whatever direction you point and burns those that it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round.

Speaker 2
30 feet. Okay.

Speaker 1
It can ascend or jump 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature it stops moving for the round. It deals 3d6 points of damage, of fire damage to that creature through a successful reflux, it negates that damage. Rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, ignites funnable substances a touch and illuminates the same as a torch. See if you scroll down here It's a 66. Oh, that's greater. I'll just get the greater one for later.

Speaker 3
Okay, so it's, yeah, that can be done.

Speaker 1
This spell can start fires on a ship. Note that. *laughs* four

Speaker 3
um if all of my damage is going through I'm automatically doing 60.

Speaker 2
60 to what?

Speaker 3
I'm automatically doing 60 without rolling anything. Without fire? Without anything yet. So. Okay. That's just my strength mod.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
60.

Speaker 2
How many times did you hit him? Five. It doesn't matter because you're not getting the DR anyway.

Speaker 3
And then after that would be 2d10. Okay. And then 2d6 and a 46.

Speaker 2
On top of the fire damage.

Speaker 3
And then fire damage happens. Another 5d6 fire damage.

Speaker 2
56 times 1.5. They might have fire vulnerability. I take an extra 50% from all fire damage.

Speaker 3
So, I'm assuming I would... I'm not focusing on anything.

Speaker 2
You punch the crap out of this thing. It also starts bursting into flames as the flames catch into its body.

Speaker 3
Which would be hilarious, because every time you hit it, hits and then starts a fire and then you hit it and it starts a fire.

Speaker 2
It spreads real quick, like unnaturally, well not unnaturally, but quicker than fur should catch fire.

Speaker 3
So I have fire for the next six rounds.

Speaker 2
Five foot step there. And bring down the hammer. the hammer is my fist oh no they have claws not fists that's weird the golems do these type of golems do what's your AC? 32

Speaker 4
I actually have more AC than you do

Speaker 3
I know that's what I said you're my tank you're the tank now not because of this robe especially when you put it on the first time I was like yep Ysma's now the tank Oh, shit.

Speaker 2
Oh, shit. Take... Do you want all the damage together? Or separate?

Speaker 4
All together, because I don't have any.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 4
Like, if we stood next to each other, it'd be like the combination of Superman and One Punch Man.

Speaker 2
Take 59 damage. It's a closet yet voice. This thing is unforgiving in its want to tear you limb from limb. *Sigh* is in your direction.

Speaker 3
I think I did grow. Uh... 32.

Speaker 2
Alright, take 2 points of strength damage. You don't have like 4 to 2 division, right?

Speaker 3
I didn't know there was a thing.

Speaker 2
I think it's called Metal.

Speaker 3
That's a thing.

Speaker 2
I will be looking into it. Some classes, the Dwarven Defender and the something else that's defense based has these abilities, but I don't know if monks get it ever.

Speaker 3
Not that I don't know. It's basically... It doesn't come natural.

Speaker 2
Okay, it's basically evasion, but with fortitude saves. And, uh... Okay. Dwarven defender and something else gets it as a class feature. It's not a very common thing, but I figured it'd ask because I don't know monks. Um, but Yzma. There is a... Big cat. Lightless fire, and there's a big cat that you feel like it might be able to reach you in. can totally reach you. Yeah, so

Speaker 4
um, okay so it has the reach to get me, because it's at the moment, but you could five foot

Speaker 2
back, and then... Yeah, five foot back,

Speaker 4
please, and... You now feel like it

Speaker 2
could not reach you. Thank you, and

Speaker 4
then heavenly fire, celestial bloodline.

Speaker 1
Can't avoid all the fire. Can't avoid all the fire.

Speaker 2
It might be a reflex save, I don't know. Uh, it's a ranged touch. Oh. it's a touch attack range touch oh not very good

Speaker 4
let's see 9 10 plus 13 so

Speaker 2
32 range touch oh yeah you touched it with it's normal AC it's touch AC did not stand a chance

Speaker 4
And then it's 64 plus 23. So 64.

Speaker 2
Is this fire damage or is this holy damage? Oh, heavenly fire. Because it's called heavenly fire. So I don't know if it's holy damage or not. But it does make a difference.

Speaker 4
This damage is divine. Okay. And not subject to any energy resistance or immunity. This ray heals good creatures. Blah, blah, blah. yeah okay 6 oh 6d4 not d6

Speaker 1
what letter are you D

Speaker 2
what happened to D was that the one that you just punched

Speaker 4
yeah I think so

Speaker 2
what happened to B was B the one that

Speaker 4
fell off the cliff yeah that was the one that retreated yeah 3, 2, 5, 5, 10, 10, 17. 40 points of divine damage.

Speaker 2
Divine unnegatable damage. Yep. 40. This guy is on his last legs. like may god of whoever you talk to have mercy upon yourself I don't know why I was going with that I like how you don't have a deity and you're like I use heavenly fire as a conjurer

Speaker 4
I always ask whatever bean it is I'm like who do you hate the most which god do you hate the most I'm not a fan of Norberger okay well in that case

Speaker 2
Norberger, please guide my hand as I strike this guy down Okay It was Mitra? Oh My face Who's after Oh, it is

Speaker 4
Yeah

Speaker 2
There's fire right next to it What's that What's that Pokemon We'll save It's Snorlax It's Snorlax Well You can make an attack of opportunity If you so choose It's getting up in there It's getting away from the fire Yeah, you're going to do the attack of opportunity? You have a range weapon out, don't you? Never mind You can still swing it at it like a club, right? Sure

Speaker 1
Improvise a weapon, so might as well I've got the flame out I'll just rotate the flame around

Speaker 3
This is attack of opportunity

Speaker 2
It's a quick little swat at him Yeah, free swat.

Speaker 1
I don't know what you do. How do you even rate hitting it with the edge of your...

Speaker 4
It's a club.

Speaker 1
Stick it up its nose?

Speaker 4
You swing it at him. Yeah, kind of like a staff.

Speaker 1
We'll treat it like a staff.

Speaker 4
You have a long bow, right? Yeah, you'd roll an attack with your base attack bonus.

Speaker 2
And this will be a strength-based attack, not a dexterity-based attack.

Speaker 4
Whatever your base attack bonus is.

Speaker 1
I don't know. Plus 14?

Speaker 4
Yeah, so you roll a 20 plus that. No, it's going to be... Mine's plus 8, so...

Speaker 3
Take away 9.

Speaker 1
Take away 9? Yep. Why 9?

Speaker 3
Because that's part of your dex. Oh, like for a ranged attack.

Speaker 2
Yeah, she'll be using her strength instead of her dex.

Speaker 3
No, 14 plus 1.

Speaker 1
14 plus 1

Speaker 3
No, that's your base attack 14 plus 1

Speaker 1
So 15 plus 1

Speaker 2
29 29 total Alright, you smack it Roll a d6 and add your strength Strength mod

Speaker 4
3

Speaker 1
3, yeah I hit it for 3

Speaker 4
It's more than it had before

Speaker 1
Yeah, I guess

Speaker 2
I mean in all honesty it could have made a difference

Speaker 1
Look I gave it a scratch

Speaker 2
I mean if you maxed you would have killed it in all honesty 6 points of damage when you killed it 7 points of damage but instead it's going to um move to 10 feet but that's pounds so as it goes by it's going to bite you and claw you. No, it's not. And Yuzma, what's your AC? 35! 35? And it doesn't hit anyone. Well, it tried. Ileano, would you care to do the honors? I assume you don't move it through your own space because then you'd hit yourself.

Speaker 1
He's got to roll it around.

Speaker 2
What's the reflexive? 17. 17? All right. It dies. Because it's 3d6, right? So even at minimum damage, it dies. Actually, at minimum damage, could just 5 if it wasn't... Oh, yeah. Sorry. The flame is actually still about... Hey, look. There's light from this flame. as he moved it that 10 feet over light suddenly appeared from the flames I mean it it's only dim light so like to you it doesn't even matter but like to the humans Yizuma can now see a lot better well she has a light source anyway but um who's after they died horrible deaths usually it's Liana yep she just So Luther, got two golems that don't like your face. She goes before Luther, right? She moved the flame. You still have a standard action. Oh, she moved the flame. Got it. You still have a standard action if you want to.

Speaker 1
Well, they're way the hell over there. Even if I put out my flame, then I still have to wait to shoot, right?

Speaker 2
Well, you can shoot one arrow.

Speaker 1
Shoot one arrow.

Speaker 2
That's a standard action.

Speaker 3
Your first attack will shoot one attack. Have two arrows.

Speaker 2
I don't need this page anymore.

Speaker 4
Of all the monsters I fought, this is the worst monster ever.

Speaker 2
Of all the monsters I fought, I don't like this one the least.

Speaker 1
I already rolled for all this stuff so I don't know if I should use what I roll or redo it.

Speaker 2
Just roll the first one. Are they evil? Uh, no. They are automatons. 37? Oh yeah, you totally hit. And you're gonna be shooting this guy because he's the only one you have a line of effect to.

Speaker 1
Okay. So then it's two arrows for the first one anyways. So. So, does electrical affect it? You might be about to find out. Okay, well, I shoot it with electrical. Okay. So, that's not evil, so that doesn't fall in. So, if I'm right, each arrow, if the electrical hits, each arrow will be 28 points of damage.

Speaker 2
That's two. 56 plus the electrical or with the electrical? With the electrical. Okay.

Speaker 1
Without the electrical, it would be 9 points for each arrow, so it's minus 18.

Speaker 2
The electrical seems to affect it. Yes. I picked the right one.

Speaker 1
There's always that chance that I picked the wrong one. What did I just say? 56? 28 plus 28? 28, yeah.

Speaker 2
But it doesn't seem to do as much damage as you had hoped.

Speaker 1
Well, duh.

Speaker 2
Because I only hit it once. It's only, well, even with you hitting it once, it seems to be resisting.

Speaker 1
Right.

Speaker 2
Or resistant to that type of damage. Luthor. There's one up in your grill. There's one not so up in your grill.

Speaker 3
Just because if it does hit at least a lot of damage will go through.

Speaker 2
a five-foot view if that's okay.

Speaker 3
I assume that's... You can get the extra added length of that. It won't even matter because I could fly into it. He's within 40 feet.

Speaker 2
Right. I was just moving to position your guy more accurately on the map.

Speaker 3
Ooh. I think that one might actually miss. Come on, crit. Nope. Okay, so does a 26 hit? Nope. 29? Nope. 34? Yes. All right, everything sits.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
So he will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Oh, they're on deck. I'm going to go ahead and *shrie*

Speaker 2
Is this fire elemental damage?

Speaker 3
No, this is just the jab style.

Speaker 2
Do you have fire elemental damage?

Speaker 3
I do have fire elemental. Okay.

Speaker 2
Six.

Speaker 3
This is a fire elemental. I'll save this separately if that matters.

Speaker 2
Uh, it is fire?

Speaker 3
Yep. Okay.

Speaker 2
You guys like to choose the one element that works well. I didn't say that. All the elements affect these golems equally. I'll just roll that bluff check right now.

Speaker 3
Oh, that one!

Speaker 2
I don't know. That's awesome.

Speaker 3
138.

Speaker 2
How many hits?

Speaker 3
Six.

Speaker 2
138. That hurt it a lot. It doesn't like you anymore.

Speaker 3
Oh, wait. I missed one. 138 plus 15. 138 plus 15. 153.

Speaker 2
153. It definitely doesn't like your face anymore.

Speaker 4
Is there a bit of time it did not like its face? Or he did like its face?

Speaker 2
It might have started neutral with his face. But now, now it doesn't like your face no more. It associates you and not liking things that look like you. Was any of that damage negated by that minus two strength that you took? Yep. Okay. You already covered it. Yep.

Speaker 3
It took me two plus eleven on my power attack versus plus twelve.

Speaker 4
Well, this is concerning. Me split. Did he just jump over it? Bless you.

Speaker 2
No, he walked over it.

Speaker 4
He just stepped over it.

Speaker 2
Yep. He walked on it like it was not a space that he could fall down. Oh, got it. Like a hair walk or something. Or something. Or something. What is your AC? I don't think that matters.

Speaker 1
I need a 4. My AC?

Speaker 3
106. Well, then it does matter.

Speaker 2
Since I didn't think it would matter, given their perchant to hitting things hard. Take 28 damage. As it claws into you. Torso-ish region. Pucker. It is not smart enough to think of that tactic. So, Luthor. Need another fortitude save for now. Since you hit it so many times, it's deciding to lessen the damage you do when you hit it.

Speaker 3
He's going to have to work more than that.

Speaker 2
Okay, take two points of strength damage. As a shadow blasts you. and Yzma there's one a lot closer to you than it was a moment ago yeah and it is not making you feel very comfortable it is not yet within claw your face off distance though

Speaker 3
I'm only strong I'm no longer super strong Well, because you keep making your saves. I don't know where.

Speaker 2
To be fair, you might take that same amount of damage if you didn't take your save. But the potential of how much more you would take, that would be the minimum amount. Correct. And you'd be staggered every round.

Speaker 3
I'm assuming I'd be taking half. That's just my assumption.

Speaker 2
but you can assume that you're very unknowingly grateful that you're making your fortitude saves

Speaker 4
we're going to use the gem of brightness and we're going to use the command word to shoot out gem of brightness yeah you gave that out as I think random loot for a while back does this have a level

Speaker 2
it is a CL 6th level. So level 3 light spell? Or level 3 spell?

Speaker 4
CL 6th, so caster level?

Speaker 2
Caster level, yeah. Usually it's half. Yeah, so that would be 3. Unless it's a specific spell.

Speaker 4
And the command word for this is we'll shoot out a flare and a blinding flash of light in a 30 foot cone. you know what we're just going to do the first command word which is a ray one foot diameter 50 feet long strikes ranged touch attack any creature touched by this is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC fortitude save we're going for the light portion of this here right

Speaker 3
you lost that you know what is the weirdest thing when you have tinnitus and then it stops for a second and i'm like and then it starts again i'm like okay i was i don't remember i told you the

Speaker 4
story when i was an apprentice electrician and stop me if i told you it i was in a plant doing a job and i was like i want to say maybe 19 at the time and i'm in this plant taking lunch and all the millwrights like these are guys in their 60s and 70s sitting around me and they're eating their lunch and they're all talking about all these different medications and they're comparing like medications and stuff and they all stop talking and they look down the table at me and i'm eating and i look over like you don't know what it's like i wake up and not and not feel any pain and think you're dead you know i'm like it's like 19 nothing hurts yet now i'm in my you know i'm almost 50 and i'm like god everything fucking hurts so i know what you i know what you mean when uh

Speaker 3
I was having bad problems with my back for a long, long time. And then when I became an eye worker, I went away. And I woke up one day without the pain in my back, and I didn't know what to do. It was that messed up.

Speaker 4
I've had back surgery. I had rods put in and decompressed all the whole nine yards. And I've had that happen where I must have slept right one night, and all of a sudden I'm like, what the hell is this? I feel like a young man. Oh, there it is. Should have moved. There it is. should have stayed where I was. Because every morning, every day, it just aches all the time. Sorry, it's my go. The light. Could I do the range touch

Speaker 2
then? Yep.

Speaker 4
19. Range touch. Touch AC? Yeah. Yep. And then blinded for 1d4 rounds. That'll make a fortitude

Speaker 2
save. What's the DC?

Speaker 4
14.

Speaker 2
Not blind.

Speaker 4
Not blind.

Speaker 2
As you hit it with this light beam, it actually, the ambient light within 60 feet of this all comes back as you seem to express the shadow aura, and it starts moving less quickly.

Speaker 4
It's slowing. I'll take that as a win.

Speaker 2
And that's a no save. There's no save on that part. I'm going to get you... Ileana, not Ileana. Fortitude saves.

Speaker 1
Why me?

Speaker 4
I've only got eight charges left on that, so something's got to happen soon. Can't slow him down forever.

Speaker 2
12. 12? That cloud vision that you had completely closes off. You no longer are able to see.

Speaker 1
Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2
It's your turn. You have no vision anymore.

Speaker 1
I know the wall is on my right, correct? Yes. I drop to the ground and get as close to that wall as possible. Okay. That's it. That's all I can do.

Speaker 3
Luther just would tell you just to focus your will and it'll just clear up. Focus your inner spirit and it'll...

Speaker 2
Luther also is self-centered when it comes to his own healing. True. Do you army crawl, or do you slide along the wall, or do you just kind of hunker down?

Speaker 1
I drop as far down as I can, so that it's making myself as small as possible, essentially.

Speaker 2
Okay. I'll say that you're taking a full defense and give you a plus four AC. Luther. that other golem is still negating all the ambient light down to dim light so it's not darkness at least because darkness in this fight would have been awful

Speaker 3
I guess I should have this before. So, I'm going to hit him first. This attack, 32.

Speaker 2
32 hits, yeah.

Speaker 3
Okay. So, with this attack, I'm going to roll this one right away because everything is going to go through. I'm using shattering punch to negate all.

Speaker 2
Oh, he's going to like you even less now. Yeah.

Speaker 3
So at least he can't have anything or quarter it or whatever he's doing.

Speaker 1
So what do I smell?

Speaker 3
These are not evil, correct? No. Good, because I have not been wrong like that.

Speaker 2
Golems are obedient. They're neutral.

Speaker 1
something's controlling him

Speaker 2
that's often the case with columns

Speaker 1
huh

Speaker 2
often the case with columns

Speaker 1
somebody should have bejeweled the eyepatch so it was one eye building

Speaker 3
so he's taking 23 non-negotiable All right, and from here on out, everything is negotiable. Is it though? Yes, but it does make a bargain. Well, if there was a way for me, and there's no skill involved, or there's nothing that did it that will allow you to put your unarmed coolness into a weapon, it's just not worth it.

Speaker 2
What is your unarmed?

Speaker 3
2d10 2d10 but so that's nothing yeah there's uh well well it's not the damage it's the

Speaker 2
all the magical bypass oh yeah that's the material doesn't flow through right yeah you know it's my will you have an adamantine great sword and still be doing 2d6 instead of 2d10 and have it be lawfully aligned and silver and cold iron and adamantine right but since you can

Speaker 3
only have a weapon that's made out of one material so my that so my idea that was part of my idea to build the nine ring the nine ring within i would be able to imbue each of the rings with that

Speaker 2
thing to make it my to make it my uh yeah i remember that initially but there was no but there was that it's yeah yeah we we looked into it i thought there was a i thought there was a monk

Speaker 3
ability that allowed you to do it and there isn't it's like the one thing that i was like oh that'd

Speaker 2
be awesome to yeah they really want you to just punch people exactly it's like also there's all these monk weapons that you could flurry with but why would anyone ever do that ever because there's

Speaker 3
absolutely never any reason to the the my meteor hammer for reach yeah that is my that's the only

Speaker 2
reason i keep it is because but when you can 30 sorry anyone who's within 40 feet of you your reach doesn't really uh well unless they're 50 feet away from in which case you would slurry

Speaker 3
with the meteor camera no it had one one use and one use only a guy was standing in a pillar of flame

Speaker 2
that was 10 feet wide that's right that's right it was hellfire pillar yeah yeah the high priest of Asmodeus was uh just standing in that hellfire not taking any damage. Dick. It worked for him until you remembered he had reach. Yep and entangle and I was able to entangle him and that was the other. Did you have the pull ability with that too? Did you pull him out of the time actually?

Speaker 3
Because I was able to um I was able to grapple him in the chain. That's right.

Speaker 2
Because I remember I was burning all projectiles in the Hellfire so that none of the projectiles were getting to them.

Speaker 4
Wait, they go before me?

Speaker 3
Yes. Oh.

Speaker 4
Where do I go on the owner then? I thought I went after your last. Luther. Oh, the golems. All right, that's right. I was thinking about the demon cats.

Speaker 2
Oh, the demon cats are dead.

Speaker 3
Does a 30...

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 3
A 17 will hit, so...

Speaker 2
17 does not hit.

Speaker 3
No, 17 on my die will hit. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2
30 does hit. 17 does not.

Speaker 3
I have one crit. And... 28 does not hit?

Speaker 2
28 is not.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 2
So...

Speaker 3
Do my crit first. Aspire the damage.

Speaker 2
How many hits after the shakran punch did you get?

Speaker 3
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5. I'm going to go ahead and put it

Speaker 2
Ah, never mind. They can't think of that strategy. Just thought of something that would have been really mean. But, these guys don't have intelligence. So, they would not think of this strategy. Huh. They're too dumb.

Speaker 4
Play Pathfinder they said. Use no math they said.

Speaker 1
Liars. Liars! Jesus. I want to get some full dice, but I don't want to spend that much. I was trying to find a full set of these ones because for some reason I'm missing half of them. The closest thing I found they want 60 bucks for a set of dice. I'm like, they're just fucking resin. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3
152.

Speaker 2
152. you needed it kind of jerks around a bit and then it just kind of clunks down on itself as it no longer seems functional uh four more rounds uh everywhere gets a lot brighter

Speaker 4
A lot brighter beating normal brighter?

Speaker 2
Normal brighter for the amount of... Your light comes back on.

Speaker 4
Awesome. So all the mushrooms come back on too? Yep. So is it safe to assume that that was the one? Or are they both together?

Speaker 2
It's safe to assume that you've negated this one with that light spell that you hit it with. And that it also slowed. Liana, what... Not Liana. Liana, what is your AC?

Speaker 1
Now that I'm tiny, 31.

Speaker 2
31. Okay. So it raises one of its arms and just lets gravity do the rest of the work and smashes down on you. Joy. It didn't get to full attack because it's low.

Speaker 1
It makes me so much happier.

Speaker 2
Oh, it does make you so much happier because there's going to be two attacks instead.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay.

Speaker 2
Take 30 points of damage. and after that it kind of seems to be moving no no not till your turn nevermind um use mine okay

Speaker 4
I will try the Heavenly Fire again. That's... Try the Heavenly Fire one more time. Okay. Range Touch. Let's see what that does. I think. 8 plus 5. 13. 16. Range touch.

Speaker 2
16 touch. Does not. Okay. It's not by much. You feel like a little more luck and you would have had it.

Speaker 4
In that case, I will send Kronk. Kronk. over to here. So he's going to start moving past the... You know what? I'm probably not going to do that. Because I don't want him to beat the shit out of him.

Speaker 2
Make a knowledge. Arcana. 34. Slow creatures do not get a tax of opportunity. Thank you.

Speaker 4
So we're going to send Kronk across, then... He can go 60. He flies. 60. Sorry, I love it.

Speaker 2
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 60. That's a movement? Yep. Still has a standard action?

Speaker 4
Nope, we're just going to keep him there.

Speaker 2
Okay. And the golem at the end of your crew kind of goes... Starts charging up again. It seems to be functioning. The shadow aura, I mean, the light is still, the fire is still producing light, as it normally is, but it doesn't seem to be slowed anymore. Okay.

Speaker 1
That makes it Illyana's. Again? Yes, again. Didn't I just have a turn? No. Yes? Yes? Yes? No.

Speaker 2
No.

Speaker 1
I got hit.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I was asking what your ace he was.

Speaker 1
Uh. Okay.

Speaker 2
Make a wisdom or intelligence. As you're still blinded from the light.

Speaker 4
Racked up like a deuce? No? Anybody?

Speaker 1
I got it. 23.

Speaker 2
Okay. It seems that your defensive curl-into-a-ball strategy will not help you as how easily it just gutted into your shoulder blades. You feel like there might be a more effective strategy. Because this thing got you pretty easily, even with your small and cowardly seconds. He's close to me, right? Maybe. He's close enough to hit you. He was east of you And it felt like the claw came from east of you

Speaker 1
Mmm. *coughs*

Speaker 2
*coughs* I'm gonna throw your arm back.

Speaker 1
Can't use that horn because- It spells space, it spells space. Because reasons. Because reasons. Did he hit you with this club?

Speaker 2
No. He has a cloth. He has a cloth. His gauntlets are like pointed. Like, imagine a super evil dude's armor, black armor. And that's what these guys pretty much look like.

Speaker 1
Each one's considered an item, right? They're not considered an item together. Sure, each one's an item, right? Each one what? Each claw.

Speaker 2
No, it's part of the whole. For the whole. Okay. For, uh, like what purpose? Shrinking. Make a knowledge arcana check.

Speaker 1
I can't tell that one from a hole in the ground. That rolled all the way around the car across my keys. we know. 16 plus 7 is something. 23.

Speaker 2
If that spell has spell resistance, it will not work on this creature.

Speaker 1
I have so much ideas.

Speaker 2
Why do wizards create the most dangerous creatures for wizards? Like, I can't think of a single type of creature that is more dangerous to a wizard than a golem. Because of just their magical immunity. And yet, only wizards are the ones who can create them. Every spell that has spell resistance, they're just immune to. Which is a lot of them.

Speaker 4
It's their scorched earth policy.

Speaker 2
Yeah, apparently wizards are just like, you know what?

Speaker 4
If you guys piss me off enough, you're nuts.

Speaker 2
If someone's going down, I'm going down with them. Wait, no. What I meant to say was... *laughs*

Speaker 4
with appropriate robot turn off sounds.

Speaker 2
Yzma and Ilyan, you guys both have knowledge on them? Yeah. Both roll it right now.

Speaker 1
25

Speaker 2
36 You know that golems Are super obedient To whatever the commands are And they didn't come at you Until you were in this area But you pieced together where they were Previously Before you entered this area Before there was any creatures in this area And you remember that their air walk ability only works while their shadow aura is on. And you conclude that if there's no one to attack in this snake way, they would return to where they were. And this one, you deactivated his shadow aura.

Speaker 4
Okay. So the idea is if we back off.

Speaker 2
Like this flash of inspiration, like this thing is so dumb that it might just try to go back into place and wait to attack the next person. It might try to reset itself if we back off.

Speaker 4
So if you follow the sounds of my voice. Oh wait, Shadow Aura is gone, right? So you can see now? She can't see. She can't? She's blinded. I'm blinded. Follow the sounds of my voice. Come this way. Come this way.

Speaker 2
Walk this way. With the 26, you know that shadow golems are not smart enough to make a trick like that.

Speaker 1
Alright, so I guess move as quickly backward as possible.

Speaker 2
You do also think like, oh shoot, but I just sent my dragon in there too. That's another thought that you have.

Speaker 1
So I'm just retreating backwards as fast as I can get. It's the second time in a row I've retreated when I've gotten low on hit points.

Speaker 2
To be fair, it's better than getting a full attack on you in the next round. Because he's been easily hitting you with the one attack.

Speaker 1
The fire should probably be gone by now. I'm assuming.

Speaker 4
Seven rounds, right? Sphere of... Flaming Sphere? Luthor. Seven rounds for you.

Speaker 2
Yuzma is sounding the retreat whisper. Ten caster level? Five caster level. If that changes what your plan was. Yuzma has sounded the retreat we should get out of here. I've got a plan. Plan. Plan. Oh. Whether that influences your decision or not is up to you.

Speaker 3
Well, my whole thing was I was going to take the aggro off of them and put it on me.

Speaker 2
You're still probably going to do that. I'll be honest.

Speaker 3
That was my goal. Okay. So. What was the flying kick? A barrage on him. It really is. And the first one is, let me finish up here.

Speaker 1
So one round per level, which is 10 rounds. 100 feet plus 10 feet per level. So 200 feet. Five diameter sphere.

Speaker 4
Five foot diameter?

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 4
So one square.

Speaker 1
Yeah. So I can keep it between me and it, but that's about it.

Speaker 3
So he takes 33 unnegotiable.

Speaker 1
33?

Speaker 3
Yep.

Speaker 2
That's number C right? Yeah. Because A is dead.

Speaker 3
So then, I'm just finishing up the rest of it. Unless anything has changed from the other one, my lowest was a 34.

Speaker 2
Nope. I mean that.

Speaker 3
Well actually my lowest was a 26. 26 does not. Correct. Okay.

Speaker 2
How many hits in total?

Speaker 3
Not including Shepard, I'll see. Seven.

Speaker 2
Seven? Yep. Are you able to dance after you fling kick or do you have to stay in that square? Nope. do you want to be where you want to be? Yuzma did sound or retreat.

Speaker 3
Quite honestly, because there's a wall there.

Speaker 2
It's kind of more of a slope-ish than a wall.

Speaker 3
Well, if I can be on this side, I'll be on this side.

Speaker 2
An Acrobatic DC-10 would make you be able to do that.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 2
And since your acrobatics is enough to beat that, I'm sure...

Speaker 3
I did not roll a one.

Speaker 2
Okay. These are more slope-slash-steps than they were cliff faces like the other ones. These guys could use them as steps pretty easily, given their size. Thank you.

Speaker 3
Total 162.

Speaker 2
162. Okay. it's going to retaliate on the closest target that should what's your AC? 32 okay it's going to hit you twice

Speaker 3
one vote total damage uh yeah because I never turned on my well yeah because I never turned on my frickin' damage reduction thing that I was so happy to have. Really should remember to turn that on.

Speaker 2
Take 51 points of damage. And Yzma. Yzma.

Speaker 4
Oh, let's see. I'm going to attempt another... Well, I don't want to do the breath weapon because you're in the way now. I'm good. You can do the breath weapon. Trust me, I can take it.

Speaker 2
You can stick to your original plan. The one that came up with six seconds ago.

Speaker 4
Yeah, that's true. Well, he did move. I'm going to back off a little further. So just wherever I feel is out of line. And I'll bring Kronk back. So he'll make it about halfway back.

Speaker 2
Oh, hell no. He casts his Atwill Invisibility. And moves full 60p. Kronk is smart. Fairy dragons have Atwill Invisibility. there's no reason for him to not be invisible all the time I am verifying that

Speaker 4
I'm sorry but I thought I did make him invisible because I couldn't he didn't but I trust you I'm still going to look it up now

Speaker 2
I feel the fairy dragon from book one then he had invisibility at will um Yep.

Speaker 1
Still can't see.

Speaker 4
Greater invisibility. You're right. It's greater invisibility? It's greater. At will? At will? Yep. Self-only.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Self-only. Three times a day? Yep. Oh. That's right. Because they're all in the acid four rounds.

Speaker 3
Whenever it wants.

Speaker 2
That's right.

Speaker 3
As long as it's three times a day.

Speaker 2
I thought it was normal invisibility at will, but it's greater invisibility three times, which is... quite a fair trade off. I use him so rarely that I don't look up his stats when I should. It's like I'm a monk that doesn't know something. You feel like you might be out of danger. Okay. But you also feel like you don't have sight. I'm gonna

Speaker 1
start whacking myself with my with my With your wand? With the rod the healing rod, yeah.

Speaker 2
The wand of healing? Alright. Make a caster level check. Grab the wrong wand.

Speaker 1
I only got the one in the pocket. I don't know how many I can have, but alright.

Speaker 2
What spell is it?

Speaker 1
It's just the... It's a... It's a... Cure light. Cure light wounds.

Speaker 2
Light? Okay, make a cast for that picture. So, D20 plus one.

Speaker 1
Fucker.

Speaker 2
If it's off the table, re-roll. Always re-roll.

Speaker 1
A wand? That's not fair.

Speaker 2
So you use the wand. It uses a charge. Nothing happened. Okay. Make an arcana check. Use a magical device.

Speaker 1
16.

Speaker 2
16? Yep. That should have worked. But you feel like the magical energy from the wand flowing in your hand because you know how magic feels like from a wand. and you're like, yeah, I used it. Why am I not feeling any better? Luther.

Speaker 3
I thought he was going to do something.

Speaker 2
Wait, did I miss him? Oh, he goes after you. No, I hit you twice. I hit him for like 51 damage. Because I hit you twice. Right.

Speaker 3
For some reason, I thought more was going to happen.

Speaker 2
No, he just hit you pretty dang hard. I mean, I assume that's pretty dang hard. Lifting one damage. I don't think it's something to scoff at.

Speaker 3
So, one, two, three. It was a failure, but not a critical failure.

Speaker 2
Are you full attacking him?

Speaker 3
Uh, yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2
Do enough damage to him? I'm sorry. You got 10 HP before that full attack.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. I would definitely transfer around that first attack more than 10.

Speaker 2
Because that first attack would have been shattering fun? Yeah. Yeah. as I claimed part of me kind of wanted to see him return to place and just fall down that pit but you only have three rounds left before his shadow aura would kick back in after a hard fought battle you have defeated the demon panthers and the shadow golems nice demon panthers

Speaker 4
Only one of you went blind. I'd like to check over the golems and just see if I can get any more information on them that's relevant. Do the demon panthers fade away?

Speaker 3
Put away Kronk. Yes, they start fading away. That's right, they were demons. They were demons.

Speaker 2
Yeah, their bodies aren't left behind.

Speaker 3
Do you know how hard it is to get demon panther teeth?

Speaker 2
I mean, they're slowly fading away. So if you wanted to collect...

Speaker 3
If I can grab some, I'm going to. Oh, yeah, you can.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Not from the one that fell down the cliff. No, not that. But there are three other options. I will grab the one that died right here. You notice... Make a perception check on the golems.

Speaker 4
Perception for him or me?

Speaker 2
You're inspecting golem, right? Yeah, perception. And I'm pulling...

Speaker 4
Thankfully we're higher level. Perception of... 19. 19? Anything of interest with the golems in general?

Speaker 2
Okay. You notice that both of them have the same insignia on a portion of their armor. in the same location. Do you have knowledge nobility?

Speaker 4
I do. Pretty good, actually.

Speaker 1
Those are actually not bad. Those thin wave ones are almost like... 28.

Speaker 2
These guys, as you had previously suspected, came from needles. Needle. Needle. the neighboring country to the northwest of Chicago. And that family sigil of... I'll... Let's spell it. I-L-V-A-R-A-N-D-I.

Speaker 4
Can you spell that one more time? I'm sorry.

Speaker 2
I-L-V-A-R-A-N-D-I. that family is pro-thrune but not willing not enough to have given such treasures over but they are you feel like with some persuasion on a closer thrune they might have borrowed them to a specific one, Brizali who might have have silver tongues out of them. You know that they're not allied enough that if the Queen's request came in by letter, they would do so. But perhaps Brasali had met or hosted them here to persuade them to let him borrow such valuable servants. I share this, of course. It is weird that such valuable servants were used in the darkness, but given what you're here for, it does make sense that a golem would be a very valuable guardian because they are not needed to feed and or take care of in any way. They will debilently attack. You're searching for a horcrux. Yep. So, um, the Shadow Panthers, on the other hand, may have just been here. From other areas of the Underdark, they're not known to be servants of... Oh, sorry, you know them as Demon Panthers. Demon Panthers. Demons don't usually serve, unless they're, like, bent to do so by force. Because they are very chaotic, as they are evil. I mean, that's what Luthor's taught me about demons. Yep, demons, yeah, those demon panthers probably are not working with the Shadow Gollums. And it was weird that Shadow Gollums reacted to you guys and not to the panthers.

Speaker 4
Alright. Good job, everybody. Should we move on?

Speaker 1
I think so. Can I try to figure out?

Speaker 3
Potion of restoration, cure blindness. That's right, she's blind.

Speaker 2
Potion of restoration?

Speaker 4
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1
Am I seeing guide owl? Am I seeing eye go?

Speaker 2
Make a knowledge arcana. You already have.

Speaker 4
22. What? 22. That's my lowest possible roll.

Speaker 1
Fix me.

Speaker 2
Oh, great knowledge gods. I beseech you. Will it a restoration spell of some sort? Kill, cure, not kill. The blindness.

Speaker 1
Please don't kill me.

Speaker 2
Since you're not entirely sure the species of these demon panthers, You haven't pieced together if it'll work or not.

Speaker 4
We can give it a try. It's an expensive try if it fails.

Speaker 1
What's the worst thing that happens? I broke my eyes, but I'm blind, so it wouldn't matter.

Speaker 2
I mean, it's still there.

Speaker 1
It's not like you lost your eyes. No, but am I able to... Surrounded by darkness? But am I able to open my lids? Yeah.

Speaker 2
I mean, your eyes are so functional, except for the part that... Your vision is strong. Not your eyes.

Speaker 4
I'm game to try if you have it. Smoke if you got them. Yeah.

Speaker 1
I mean... Go for it, whatever. What luther do you have?

Speaker 4
You literally... You have one.

Speaker 1
Have what? Potion of frustration? I have potions? I have the potions of cure serious wounds.

Speaker 2
She may not have opened that bag yet. Okay. Yeah. I thought they were scrolls. Oh, I thought they were potions. There are three scrolls.

Speaker 1
No, there's ten. There's ten. Oh, three scrolls of restoration. Yeah, no, I haven't even looked in there. And even if I didn't look, I might see shit. Why? Because I can't see. What? Do you want me to use it on you? Sure, let's see what happens.

Speaker 2
So she pulls out a bag that you guys don't remember her having before entering that dragon layer and pulls out a scroll from it. What does this say? Someone help. I think this might work.

Speaker 4
Is it one of those scrolls or a different scroll that she pulls out? There's three scrolls. Is this a Hadney Habersack?

Speaker 2
There's five scrolls. There's five scrolls. I'm sorry. There's five scrolls. Yes. So she can actually pull it out. She also pulls out the one she wants. Oh, is it a Handysack? I thought the Bag of Holding you called out what you wanted. You had that Bag of Holding.

Speaker 3
No. Bag of holding, you actually have to reach in and grab. Andy Habersack, you reach in and you know what you're grabbing, and it automatically comes to your hand.

Speaker 2
Because I did randomly roll that. You pulled a scroll of raised dead instead. Yeah, I have those too.

Speaker 1
So if I die, you know. All right, let's give it a try.

Speaker 2
What is the spell level of restoration? I got it. Scroll of restoration. It doesn't say what level it is.

Speaker 4
Level four.

Speaker 2
So roll a d20 and add eight.

Speaker 4
Me?

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 4
17.

Speaker 2
Okay. You start going magic, magic, magic, magic.

Speaker 4
And the scroll

Speaker 2
the ink fades away.

Speaker 4
Knowledge Arcana. What just happened there? 25. What is that? That is weird.

Speaker 2
Whatever is affecting her is also affecting magical healing. And it seems like the person casting the spell is going to need to be able to break a certain level cap.

Speaker 4
Can I spellcraft her to find out what it is? Or I can detect... So there's a magic aura on her then currently, correct?

Speaker 2
There's a necromatic around her eyes.

Speaker 4
Interesting. Interesting.

Speaker 2
I believe it's necromatic. It would make the most sense to be an acromatic.

Speaker 4
We have to bring you with us, I'm thinking. Or we have to take you all the way back home and find somebody to take care of this.

Speaker 1
I mean, I gotta do whatever I gotta do because I can't see. What are you gonna do, guide me around gigantic pits like the one we had in front of us?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 1
I just don't see this as a good idea.

Speaker 2
Yes, necromatic. Just looking to see if I have anything else. But you also know that scrolls casters come from the person who wrote them not from you casting them. So you do know that if you could cast that spell it would be a much higher chance to succeed rather than from a scroll. Um, this also affects healing on her. As she is tested with a wand. Through trial and error.

Speaker 1
Yes, I have.

Speaker 4
I wish I could cast Arcane Eye, but you as the beneficiary.

Speaker 2
Your perception comes from the floating eye that is... Can I have it float right in front of my face?

Speaker 4
Well, what do you want to do? This is your adventure as well.

Speaker 1
Well, we're going to have to go back. There's no way that I can continue forward like this. There's just not. So if we don't have a way to fix it, we've got to go back and find somebody else who can. Maybe someone at the college or something. I don't know.

Speaker 3
Or, I know some clerics.

Speaker 2
A temple of hippies. They have rituals. I don't remember if I had a blind one. But I'll make one up.

Speaker 4
Alright, so um take a look at Dimension Door

Speaker 3
I don't think Dimension Door teleport, yep yeah, Dimension Door does not go far enough

Speaker 4
Alright, so should we teleport back?

Speaker 1
I don't have a choice You guys can keep going if you really want to but I've got to go back

Speaker 2
Without Max and me, you guys can handle this, I'm sure. Bye.

Speaker 1
I don't have a choice. I gotta go back.

Speaker 2
None of the encounters so far seems like they give you any trouble, so go ahead and keep going.

Speaker 3
I'm down to less than 25% of my hit points right now. Then let's head back. I am actually beat the fuck up right now.

Speaker 2
Oh, less than 25%. I thought you said you were down 25%. I'm like, I've hit you for quite a lot of damage. How much hit points do you have? Geez. Not that many. I was going to say, I know I full attacked you with two guards.

Speaker 3
I've been...

Speaker 2
And then I realized you didn't say 25%. You were less than 25%. Right. Not 25% down. Which would have been a shocking number to find out.

Speaker 4
All right. I'll do this using three scrolls because it's a scroll. I don't have the ability. So that means I can only carry one person with, because it's only a level 5, and it's every three levels.

Speaker 2
That's a level 10 caster.

Speaker 4
For the 5th level?

Speaker 2
Yep. It's double the level of the spell. So a 10th level caster would have to cast that spell. 5th level spell.

Speaker 4
Got it. Okay, so then it does work with every 3 levels.

Speaker 2
5th level character could not cast that spell. There's no class that gives you 5th level spells at 5th level.

Speaker 4
Alright then we'll teleport back Hop Alright let's go to the hippie Hippie dippies and get it fixed up

Speaker 2
Alright so you teleport to the temple As you can see clearly on the map Do we have a time stop Today?

Speaker 1
We do not but it's up to Casey

Speaker 2
I mean a soft one or a hard one?

Speaker 4
Soft I don't mind going over it I do have stuff to do but it's not like a deadline to do stuff It's more project work Because it is 430 now.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 3
I'll bring that up. I just realized there's an ability to... Teleport to the hippie-dippies? I wish. No.

Speaker 2
No, that's where you went.

Speaker 3
Any poison that hits me that doesn't take effect, I could then turn into an attack. A touch attack. Like redirect it?

Speaker 2
You can redirect poisons? So if I... Make a fortitude save against a poison.

Speaker 3
Well, no, because with Diamond Body, I don't take damage from poison. But there's an ability called Cobra Breath that whenever I neutralize a poison, I can instead release that poison into a touch attack.

Speaker 2
Oh, my God.

Speaker 3
Mugs are so weird.

Speaker 2
I say this every session because you always find weirder and weirder things that you can do.

Speaker 4
I was really hoping for something that I could, like, spend key points on. You know that some guy approached somebody at Piazzo and says, I'd like to have a monk, some sort of monk in here. And Piazzo was like, okay, fine, you write that and we'll put it in. And nobody proofread it.

Speaker 2
Nobody proofread it. These are all the things that they could do. But level 18, they can... You have to choose which ones that I want to turn into.

Speaker 3
This was a level 12 thing. I had to have chosen it at level 12 in order to make it. Which temple are we going to?

Speaker 2
The Temple of Shelae. Shelae, okay. The Hippie Dippie Temple. Boonk. Whoa.

Speaker 4
There's like people here again. Yay. How's it going? So, problem. We need your help. Yeah. Our friend here is blinded. Oh, no.

Speaker 2
That's the worst, man. That's the worst. You know why? Because then you can't appreciate art. That's true. Or the beauty of the world. Yeah. The world is beautiful, man. Yeah.

Speaker 4
Yeah. Anyway, can you help her? It was a necromancy, sort of necromancy.

Speaker 2
We can take care of it, man. But, like, there's a donation plate over here? Yeah. And we can cast a bestow curse on there as a ritual that'll guarantee you to succeed. So you need... A low, low price of donations, man.

Speaker 4
Okay, what sort of donation would you appreciate? I don't want to make this a transactional thing necessarily, but I would like to I would like to show my appreciation for your work.

Speaker 2
You used a lot of words. And we just... How much money do you need? Like...

Speaker 3
Would a thousand gold be good? A thousand gold is fine. That's like more than a hundred.

Speaker 4
Funded the church for the next ten years? Yeah, something like that. We've given them a lot of money. Which is weird because we don't get any credit with them at all. Meaning, you've already given them a lot of money. You think they were just doing it.

Speaker 2
You've given them a lot of money every time you need them to do something for you.

Speaker 4
Yeah, so we've created this problem.

Speaker 2
You have not actually donated any money. You have paid for the services.

Speaker 3
I have never come here on my own without a problem and given them money.

Speaker 2
Given them money and then they'll fix it for you. Correct. All right.

Speaker 4
So it's very Pavlovian. Like, they hear the bell. They know the food dish is ready to go.

Speaker 2
Here's your goals. Okay.

Speaker 4
But they don't want to tell you what they want.

Speaker 2
We're going to put these goggles on you. and you're going to keep spinning these around and around and all the colors are going to be twirling around some people call it a scolopokide and you're just going to keep twirling them for the next hour and then you'll be all good with your visions I'm going to make notes of what that

Speaker 4
is called so that way he has to remember in the future

Speaker 1
do I need to bring the goggles back when I'm done or do I need to

Speaker 2
stay here because we're going to pray around you because we're that kind of people we're going to start chanting everyone Get ready to chant, man. It passes it to the next guy. And the smoke comes out. And they're sitting in a beanbag circle around you. And they keep chanting around in the circle.

Speaker 4
his actual bean bags that's great

Speaker 2
you're welcome to actually join the chant if you want

Speaker 4
why not, I'm going to enjoy the chant

Speaker 2
so as it comes to you I'm going to make a fortitude set and it's poison oh look at that, that's a good one

Speaker 4
that's a good one

Speaker 2
is it like 3?

Speaker 4
no that was actually 30

Speaker 2
okay gets a lot more vibrant. Yeah. That makes sense. But you don't feel like you need, like you, don't feel like you couldn't leave your beanbag chair if you so choose. If I could take that,

Speaker 3
I can imbibe the poison, and then hit it with somebody else. Luther, are you turning the beanbag circle? No. Because it doesn't have an effect, and it's boring.

Speaker 2
Why drink it if I don't get drunk? And they all stare at you. Like, after you, like, And they'll kind of stare at you. You do that with your... And then you pass it on to the next guy. Pop pop camp, motherfuckers!

Speaker 4
Fucking up the rotation!

Speaker 2
And they'll, like, this melodious every time they exhale as the smoke rises around you. You start breathing in this smoke as you continue spinning these colors. And after an hour passes, Um, you do have your vision returned, but you feel very dizzy.

Speaker 4
Craig, I'm going to get you high today. You ain't got a job, and you ain't got shit to do.

Speaker 2
See? Told you we could fix her, man. Yeah. Rituals always work. Remember that gnome, man? We had to fix him because he was cursed. Yeah, we got rid of the curse from his body. Those were good times. We have one up here. And he points out a picture of a gnome who has been finger-painted and then pressed himself against a canvas. I thought he was a halfling. I thought he was a gnome. He might have been a halfling. He was short. Yeah, he was short. That gnome or halfling. But he's smaller because he's like that big and we're like this big. I thought he was. Ah, he might have been a halfling. I thought he was halfling. I feel more and more now that you say halfling, that is accurate.

Speaker 3
I just know he was not a member of the Bufur-verse. The Bufur-verse. The Bufur-verse. I don't remember the time you said it and I never knew what the fuck you were saying. Yeah, Bufur-verse.

Speaker 2
I'm part of the Bufur-verse. The Belfower-tillers? Yeah, the bell flip terms. I have a cat.

Speaker 3
That's actually a panther.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I have a cat. Okay, you have a cat going around you. I'm going to use my cat to flank. It's a house cat. How threatening is it? No, it's a panther. What? You've been having... You've had this cat following you around? You've been calling it a cat, and you've been walking around down with a panther? As a halfling? He could ride it. It was large enough for you to ride? And you kept telling everyone that you had a cat?

Speaker 4
That was Bill, right?

Speaker 2
Yep. There was a number of surprising things that happened from Bill's character. It's a cat. Because he kept forgetting about it like you're a dragon, except it wasn't a cat-sized dragon like what you have. It was an actual panther that he kept calling a cat. So every time he did bring it up, everyone pictured a cat. Yeah, I have a cat with me. Even when he was saying, he was like, well, I'm... Oh, I almost forgot about a cat. I'm just going to say it's with me. okay your cat's with you no it's a it was a panther we found that out in like the fortress where you got your cupcake wish that he had a panther with him the whole time not a whole the whole time it was a panther not a cat because he i don't think he ever made an attack roll with it because he didn't or if he did it never hit because i would wonder why this cat is doing 1d8 plus 3 damage or whatever no because all of a sudden he was like yeah i'm gonna use it to i'm gonna use it to flank you can do that you can use it with a flank i mean it's a cat is it very is it actually threatening no it's a panther it weighs it weighs 70 pounds that's what it was it weighs 70 pounds what kind of cat weighs 70 pounds it's kind of like a mountain lion but like a black mountain lion

Speaker 3
it was a very surprising character they couldn't do anything else unfortunately it was like Like a thief who couldn't thief. A fighter who couldn't fight.

Speaker 2
Yeah, you had like two levels of rogue. You had like three levels of inquisitor. Sounds very random. And like two levels of bellflower tiller.

Speaker 3
To make the bellflower tiller class thing, you needed the rogue and the inquisitor. But they didn't mix well.

Speaker 2
You had to be able to cast divine spells. And you had to be able to either like sneak. There's something that either a ranger or a rogue could get you. I think he was dealing sneak attack damage or something. Then he had the familiar, or the animal companion, from the Inquisitor, because he took the animal domain with the Inquisitor to get the cat.

Speaker 4
So it's like he's going for a very specific end goal and had to fill in all this stuff in the head.

Speaker 3
Kind of. But after we looked at the Bellflower Tillers.

Speaker 2
We looked at the Bellflower Tillers, and I couldn't figure out why you would want to play a Bellflower. I mean, for flavor, sure. Because it was a very, very flavorful class, but not good inside or outside of combat very well. Unless you were moving multiple peoples through, like, smuggling through, like, borders. Like, that's what they're designed to do, is, like, smuggle people. Like, they're the Underground Railroad. Yeah. Like, you have connections all the way, and like, conceptually, that's, you know, a fun idea. And in ChellX, sure, that could be a lot of fun, but your whole, like, 10-level prestige class is all about being Harriet Tubman.

Speaker 1
That's what I always wanted.

Speaker 2
Yeah, and I'm like, I mean, that's what you want to go. And then it finally died. And then it finally died. on the bridge. Same day as his cat. Yep, well, yeah. No, no, his cat died to the tentacles when we were fighting the wyvern. He died on the bridge. He died on the bridge. When he fought the enforcer by himself at point blank. That one got me too. I was like...

Speaker 3
He stood with a dagger

Speaker 2
and was like, I got this. Yeah.

Speaker 3
The enforcer... He had a star knife. I'm sorry. Yes, he had a star knife.

Speaker 2
But he was using it as a dagger because the Enforcer was in his grill. He did not run. I will give him that. Yes. He did not fall to fear from... God, the Enforcer. That's a creature I've got to bring back and throw at you guys again. That guy was devastating. Every time you met him, he was a fight. And Rufus, oh, pair up Rufus with the Enforcer. You guys got a grand finale coming. Rufus and the Enforcer somehow team up, even though neither of them would ever team up with the other.

Speaker 4
All right, so we're doing the ceremony.

Speaker 2
Yep, so it takes about an hour. It's about 6 p.m. when you guys leave the tower, heard from the temple. I'm going to go with... Oh, you can heal yourself again too, by the way.

Speaker 1
That's helpful.

Speaker 2
That part is removed as well.

Speaker 3
I'm gonna go with the time to go and take a break. Right. Get my key back.

Speaker 2
Get my key back.

Speaker 1
Get all my freaking...

Speaker 2
You can't open your house without your key.

Speaker 1
What?

Speaker 2
You can't open your house without a key.

Speaker 1
You actually have a key for your house?

Speaker 2
Do you not have a key in your house? You have a dog with like four key.

Speaker 1
I don't have a house. So, yeah.

Speaker 3
I'll have to sleep for like 20, 30 minutes and get it all back. All right, guys.

Speaker 2
While you guys are doing that, we're like... Well, I'm going to be... For the hour of the ritual, you just come and toast yourself for an hour? monks are so weird why do they have this ability I'm just gonna go comatose for the exact amount of time that I choose up to whatever number of days

Speaker 3
based on my that's the breathing I can stop breathing for like a day now about two days a day for every point of constitution or something

Speaker 2
I'm just gonna go comatose for my days worth of constitution that I have. Just because I can. I'm scared of shit out of some city guards when I start moving in a body bag because they were clearing out the opera house. Yeah, half of us are going to leave the opera house. The other half are going to wait here for the city guard. Luthor, what are you going to do? I'm going to go to Comatose for the next day and a half. Wake up inside a body bag and scare the shit out of some city guard.

Speaker 3
So now, the best part of this is, as the monk ability, I can actually do this now, be in suspended animation for years, because I no longer age. No longer age? Yeah, I don't age anymore. You don't age. So, any spells that...

Speaker 2
would toast yourself for... You could turn yourself into Sleeping Beauty. Yeah. Except... Except you wake up when you decide to... Not when someone kisses me. Oh my god. The monks... Why do the monks have these abilities? And the best part is, the beginning of this is a fourth level ability. Alright, so you guys rest for the day. You return back to base, I assume. Yep. Or in a few sub-chairs.

Speaker 1
Yep. Might as well. Are we going to have to go back and try this again later, or are we good? Oh, no, we have to go back there.

Speaker 4
Yeah, we're not done.

Speaker 3
The heart's down there, or either the heart's down there or the location. We could wait until our cardboard-itis friend is back. I think that's possibly a good idea, because he soaks damage better than her.

Speaker 1
Hey!

Speaker 2
You also have a different person that you use to soak damage all the time. Flynn? No, Hero. A hero.

Speaker 1
He is one of them.

Speaker 2
Hero, the actual armored fighter. Yeah.

Speaker 4
Not as good as Max, though, I think.

Speaker 2
He's a two-eapon fighter. He can hold his own against smacking. Smacking and getting smacked are about the extent of his helpfulness, but he's got the HP and the AC to back himself up. He's like a samurai with a shield. So, a samurai. A historical one, not an anime one.

Speaker 4
Well, let's say we got like 45 minutes. Do you think we should go back down there now?

Speaker 1
Get as far as we can.

Speaker 4
Oh. That's up to you guys yet.

Speaker 1
I mean, I still got more rods, wands, and hit myself with them. The problem is...

Speaker 2
You're resting now, so you get all your spells back. Right.

Speaker 1
So I'm going to have things back, so...

Speaker 2
Yes. Oh, but you don't have an in-house cleric to patch you guys up.

Speaker 1
We can hide one. I think we can afford it.

Speaker 2
Hey, man. I heard you got all bruises. That's... Those are the clerics.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, hey, they were already working on me. What difference does it make?

Speaker 2
You want us to patch you up, too? You guys look super rough.

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah.

Speaker 2
You want some, like, not hurting ointments? That would be fabulous. It's not an ointment, though. It's more of a spell. That's okay. Not cool. Honestly, what?

Speaker 4
While they were in the... I'll take an ointment. I will. Okay.

Speaker 2
It's not an ointment, though. It's more of a spell. That's fine. Okay. You're speaking my language. Cool. Yeah. There's a donation tray here? Yeah. Here's a... And it's less empty? Here's 10 gold. Oh. Okay. Well, if that's all the healing you want. And he heals you for... Oh! Maximum. 13 HP. I'll take that. Yeah, we can do better than that, but like... The donation play is still too empty.

Speaker 1
I'll give him 200 gold.

Speaker 2
Oh, you want some...

Speaker 1
I want good healing, man. If I need more, just tell me. I can...

Speaker 2
Yeah, the donation plate.

Speaker 1
How much more?

Speaker 2
Numbers are like hard sometimes. But we'll get you for the 200. 300. Oh, that's even more.

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 2
Oh, now I don't know what I'm going to do now.

Speaker 1
Fix me up, man.

Speaker 2
I'm going to patch you up with this one then. Instead of the other one.

Speaker 4
Are we going to divide all that, the coin that we found? Are we going to divide that by four ways? Get 40 hit points back on.

Speaker 3
Really, because really it was from the fight for that dragon.

Speaker 4
Yeah, no, that's what I'm asking.

Speaker 3
I know I was joking about the whole turning him around thing.

Speaker 4
I thought that'd be fun. Get 40 hit points.

Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah, we've had you up better than him because you'd put a lot more in. thanks we can help you again yeah we like helping for money because money helps with the having this is very idiocracy I like money I like sex

Speaker 4
well god I'm watching all my balls

Speaker 2
all my balls

Speaker 4
here you see the movie that's a good movie Alright, so it's 17,875 gold per person.

Speaker 2
You look like you're not as healthy as you could be. Do you want to do an 8? Nope, I'm good.

Speaker 1
How much are we getting?

Speaker 4
17,875 gold.

Speaker 3
We can fix you up a lot good. I can fix myself up. I'm good at it.

Speaker 2
But you look really like not so healthy. I'll be healthy enough. Okay man, but... Is that including all the...

Speaker 4
Nope, I'm still doing all the other stuff. 1325 platinum per. Let's split four ways. 154...

Speaker 1
13... 13...

Speaker 4
1325? 1325, yes. That's right.

Speaker 1
And then... So yeah, there it is.

Speaker 4
54.

Speaker 1
Thought that was weird. 54.

Speaker 4
And then additional gold would be in gems. It's 13500. So 13500.

Speaker 1
Each?

Speaker 3
What was your first gold? 17, what?

Speaker 1
- 17, 8, 75. So I'm gonna add that to all mine and subtract out the 300 man.

Speaker 4
- I just figured while I'm modifying my funds ledger on mine as well.

Speaker 2
- Great. - Give him 10 gold to charge.

Speaker 1
- 10.

Speaker 2
- We can have this material. - Okay so.

Speaker 3
I do

Speaker 1
38 75 13

Speaker 3
I do believe I hit my I hit the 100,000 mark already I haven't I don't honest to god since I'm going to say 13th level I've gotten most of the items how I needed them

Speaker 4
and I've been spending like crazy and I'm at 115,000 so I don't know how you just hit 100,000 if you aren't spending because I spend on stupid shit oh I mean a guy that makes a wish on a cupcake that makes total sense to me I'm not saying that to be like a jerk I'm just saying

Speaker 1
okay How many platinum are in gold?

Speaker 4
Ten. Ten. Ten per gold. Ten gold per platinum. Okay. See, I multiply it by ten, and that's my gold. Okay.

Speaker 3
I wanted, what I wanted to do was buy the, uh, buy the land that the Skull and Bones is on, where our base is. I want to buy the land. And somebody owns it. Whether they're alive or not, I don't know.

Speaker 4
I'm sure between all of us, we can convince them and be at nice or not so nice ways to sell it to us at a discount, at least, without being jerks about it.

Speaker 3
You figure at this rate right now, with just the money that I'm adding up right now is 100,000 times more than

Speaker 2
your bathroom light turns on several times when I try and turn it off. Do I not turn it right? It's automatic.

Speaker 4
It's automatic. It's actually, it's not just like a system that detects motion in the bathroom. We're using an AI controller that detects motion and with a few other things that happened in the bathroom with the motion.

Speaker 1
There's no cameras.

Speaker 4
It's just motion detectors. But the thing is people sit there on their phone and doom scroll, but some of the motion detectors don't pick up that motion really easily, so we have various timers that go off based on certain motions.

Speaker 2
I thought I couldn't turn it off on Friday, and then it happened again on today. That's because it knows you're in there. And then I move, and it will turn back on, and I'm like, no, turn off. So I thought I hit it like three times, both times, trying to turn it off. And it turned back on. And it turned back on.

Speaker 4
Because it picked up the motion of you turning it off. It's like, oh, somebody's there. Somebody's obviously trying to turn it on and fumbling around.

Speaker 2
I'm like, ah. Because it's a really sensitive switch. You don't have to flip it. It's just kind of like a little nudge. It's a toggle push button. Yeah. So I had thought every time I've used that bathroom, every time I like come on, reach back in and turn it off to try and turn it off.

Speaker 4
So, yeah, you and AI are having a little difference of agreement. You're like, no, off.

Speaker 2
And AI's like, I don't think that's what you want. I saw your hand moving there. I think you really mean on.

Speaker 4
No, off.

Speaker 2
No, you mean on. What I mean is turn it off. Click. Click.

Speaker 4
Well, I've been experimenting a lot with AI, and we have the ability to detect faces and also know who comes in the doors via, like, the key fobs. So we can kind of detect who's here. But that isn't intelligent enough to know people coming in the front door that room around, you know, wander around. So anyway, my point is like it's getting more intelligent, but there's still a long way to go. So the bathroom is the least of our arguments with AI that we have.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I thought that I did the same thing on Friday. I'm like, no, turn off. Stop turning on. Turn off. And then it happened again. I mean, there's now, ah. So I figured I'd mention that you have a very sensitive light switch I thought I was pushing it too hard. And then I pushed it too hard and it flicked back off or something. You have a very sensitive light switch. Turns out I was completely off. Good to know. So I'll see if I remember that next time. Yeah. I might come back in here and see. I'm glad you mentioned something. Say the same thing next time, too. You have a very sensitive light switch in there. You know that? All right. So, after you guys rest up, what do you plan to do? We have 5 o'clock now.

Speaker 4
Well, I think we should call it here. Sounds good to me. We have to resume. And if we don't have Max next time, we'll just do it by ourselves.

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 4
And we'll bring

Speaker 3
Hiro with us.

Speaker 2
He has not actually said anything since I reached out to him. I don't know. I mean, he took his name off of the Facebook event, which is the only reason that I knew that he wasn't able to show up today.

Speaker 4
He made a comment in the Facebook event saying that he had family in town.

Speaker 2
Oh, I didn't see that.

Speaker 4
He said apparently he had family in town.

Speaker 2
I reached out to him in Messenger. Yeah, I reached out to him in Messenger, but he had notified. Which confused me. And then I wondered, like, oh, is Facebook doing one of those weird things where it actually has to change someone's status for some reason? I didn't see it in the actual event. I kept checking the messenger. That's where I reached out to him. A nice hearted adventure down in the Underdark. That was fun. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1
It's yourself. I was flawed.

Speaker 2
It happens. Blinded by the light. Blinded without light. Down in the underdark it is all blinded now.

Speaker 1
I'm gonna find my scroll. My scroll is missing with all my other dice in it. So the scroll of dice? Yeah, you've never seen my purple scroll. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's, it's gone. Like, I can't find it. I needed to use my normal gaming bag for something else, so I took everything out and set it aside i can find everything else but the dang scroll i'm like it's gotta be here it couldn't have gone very far it's not like it got legs and walked off

Speaker 2
all right this scroll maybe you have chaos magic inside that thing which all it needs is chaos chaos magic i don't think is a thing in patlander

Speaker 1
i have enough chaos in my life i don't need any help

Speaker 2
Because the chaotic good. Oh man, for the first time in this campaign, I think the chaotic people outnumbered the lawful people. That is true. Because Andy was lawful good. Or maybe he was neutral. He was either lawful or neutral. He's way of doing it. Andy might have been chaotic good.

Speaker 1
What are you doing?

Speaker 2
Uh, Salimray. Seren Ray's neutral good. Oh, I guess he could have been chaotic good. Seren Ray's neutral good. And then JJ was lawful good. JJ was lawful good because he was a paladin. You were lawful. Lawful neutral. Bill was chaotic good. And he might have been chaotic good. If he was not chaotic good, then he played more towards the chaotic side. No, he was up good.

Speaker 1
We're here again, though. I'm serious. I thought wearing a sweater I'd be warm enough because I'm like, I'm always freezing when I wear a t-shirt.

Speaker 4
I asked you guys. I said I could turn up the heat

Speaker 1
if you wanted. I know, but turning it up, then I'll roast it up, and then I'll just...

Speaker 4
We typically keep it 60 in here, and that's because most of the people that work in here, they don't care. Like Renee, for example, the place she usually did her stuff was in a shed in her backyard. so during these months it was negative 10 so she's just happy to be here so she's like 60 not a problem I'll put on a sweatshirt but I did turn up to 65 so my point is we can always turn it up or down based on our moments

Speaker 1
our house is usually about 70, 75 I don't like it at 75 he likes it at 75

Speaker 3
so the boiler sits at if you set it at 68 it'll run to about

Speaker 1
72. And the upstairs is always hotter than the downstairs so he'll be freezing so he'll change it he'll change it in one area and then the other area will suffer one way or another. When I had a

Speaker 4
boiler it was the lower I always the lower area of the house was always like thanks keep it on but then the upper area of the house sometimes I had the windows open because it's like and honestly the

Speaker 3
boilers the boilers were made to run like that they were actually made to run with with windows cracked or open. Yeah. How the radiators work. Gavin Lee says his open all the time. He has like

Speaker 1
his air conditioner in there 24 7 365 and runs it all the time and I'm like

Speaker 3
he doesn't run the air but he runs the fan on it. Yeah. I'm like you paying for the electric bill dude?

Speaker 2
Not yet. But soon. But soon. It's starting it's going to start in January actually.

Speaker 1
He's going to start to pay. He's going to pay the electric bill? The upstairs one. The half of it. Because Chris is still upstairs and Morgan's still upstairs. So it's not really fair for him to pay all of it. But he needs to start. He's not working full time yet. He can't find a full time job without a driver's license. And he's struggling. Plus he doesn't answer things correctly when they do ask him questions. He got one call this week where he answered, Why are you calling me now? You almost cost me my job. They said, well, then we'll take you off the list. And they hung up on him. And he's like, then he texted me. He's like, they were kind of bastards, right? And I was like, no. I'm like, dude, I said, you can't talk to people like that. I said, people don't respond to that.

Speaker 2
And they're thinking that because you're, they're not going to want. Do you have any Coke?

Speaker 1
So they're not going to want anybody. Use ice purple alcohol. That takes it out of everything. That's not the point.

Speaker 4
The point is...

Speaker 2
The point is Ian's being the smartass. He is being the smartass.

Speaker 1
But you can't talk to potential employers that way. And they're going to want to hire you.

Speaker 2
Why did you call me now? You almost cost me my job.

Speaker 1
Yeah, right. Because they know he's working at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. They don't know he's working. What I said, what you should have said was, "I'm not available to talk right now. Would it be possible to talk to you guys after two?" That's what he should have said. That's not what he actually said. But he blew up his neck. - The whole of it is, we gotta go to the,

Speaker 3
we gotta go to Verizon and get his fricking voice note fixed.

Speaker 1
- Yeah, 'cause it still says, "Hi, you've reached Morgan!"
