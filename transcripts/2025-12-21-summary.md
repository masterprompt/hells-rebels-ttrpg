# Session Summary: 2025-12-21
## Hell's Rebels Campaign - Pathfinder 1e

---

## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

The party continued their exploration of the underground caverns in search of a soul-bound phylactery containing Thrune's heart. The session began with the group examining the remains of an elder red dragon and discovering a massive dragon hoard. Following the trail deeper into the caverns, they encountered shadow demon panthers and two shadow golems from the neighboring nation of Nidel. After a challenging combat that left Liana blinded by necrotic magic, the party teleported back to Kintargo for healing at the Temple of Shelae. The session concluded with the party rested and ready to continue their search, though without their cleric Max who had family obligations.

## DETAILED COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY

### Initial Exploration and Dragon Discoveries

The session opened with the party investigating dragon bones previously encountered. Liana climbed up to examine a detached femur bone pressed into the cavern wall and discovered a trail of scattered remains - a left half of a ribcage and portions of a skull surrounded by seven different limb bones. Through a sense motive check, Liana determined this chamber resembled a "rage room" where humanoid bodies had been violently torn apart and scattered, with bones smashed against walls and some even impaled in the rock face.

The party discovered two raised plateaus (20 feet high) at the north and south ends of this chamber. Liana spotted something glistening on both platforms. After some difficulty climbing, the party sent their familiars to investigate - Liana's owl to the north plateau and Yzma's fairy dragon Kronk to the south.

### The Dragon Hoard

Kronk discovered an extensive dragon hoard on the southern plateau, prompting Yzma to use companion transposition to teleport to the location. The hoard contained:

**Magical Items:**
- Bag of Holding, Type 3 (containing spices worth 2,800 gp)
- Heavy chandelier sculpted in silver with aquamarines (8,800 gp)
- Luck Blade in a Scabbard of Keen Edges (no wishes remaining)
- Ring of Telekinesis (claimed by Yzma)
- Mace of Smiting
- Gem of Seeing
- 7th level Pearl of Power
- Rod of Wonder
- Breastplate of Adamantine Armor +4
- Heavy Fortification Mithril Chain Shirt +5
- White Robe of the Archmagi (claimed and worn by Yzma)
- Wings of the Gargoyle (claimed by Luther)
- Orb of Utter Chaos (stored in Bag of Holding - dangerous for lawful characters)
- Gem of Brightness (later used in combat)

**Treasure:**
- 71,500 gold pieces (17,875 gp per party member)
- 5,300 platinum pieces (1,325 pp per party member)
- Bag of gems worth 51,000 gp total (12,750 gp worth per member)
- Two sculpted busts worth 1,500 gp each (3,000 total, 750 per member)

On the northern plateau, the party found an enormous cache of coins and gems.

### Additional Loot from the Chamber Floor

While the others explored the plateaus, Liana searched the ground level and found:
- 20 bejeweled unholy symbols of Asmodeus (250 gp each)
- 5 rings (Ring of Protection +1 each)
- Ruby encrusted rod (Rod of Lesser Quicken Metamagic)
- Small Handy Haversack containing:
  - 10 Potions of Cure Serious Wounds
  - 3 Scrolls of Restoration
  - 2 Scrolls of Raise Dead

Luther also collected:
- 12 Heavy Maces +1
- 7 Light Maces +1
- 8 Breastplates +1 with Asmodeus symbols
- Dragon horn from the elder red dragon (for dragon bone dust)

Yzma also collected a dragon horn from the elder red dragon.

### Descent into Darkness

Following Yzma's innate pull toward the soul-bound phylactery, the party continued down a descending pathway with 10-foot drops. They noticed the mushrooms in this area were not glowing, despite being present. This darkness expanded as they progressed.

### Combat: Shadow Demon Panthers

The party encountered four shadow demon panthers (quadrupedal, panther-like creatures) hiding in the dim-light area. Luther identified them as demon panthers with a religion check. Combat ensued:

**Round 1:**
- Liana shot Panther C with electrical arrows for 123 damage
- Luther used his new Wings of the Gargoyle to jump-kick Panther C, attempting to blind it with stunning fist, but the creature proved immune to the effect
- Yzma turned invisible
- Panthers moved and breathed cones of cold: Liana took 20 cold damage (half), Yzma took 20 cold damage (half), Luther took 12 cold damage (with improved evasion)
- Panther C full-attacked Luther for 16 damage (with fortitude save passed against blindness)

**Round 2:**
- Liana switched to electrical damage and hit Panther B with all four arrows for 152 damage
- Luther activated Elemental Fury (fire) and hit Panther C (killing it), Panther E for 89 damage, and Panther D for exactly 100 damage
- Yzma used her breath weapon (fire) on Panther B for 23 fire damage - the panther became terrified of the flames and fled off the cliff to its death
- The remaining panthers moved to attack

**Round 3:**
- Panthers D and E also fled from the spreading flames
- Liana moved her Flaming Sphere to kill the remaining wounded panther

Luther collected demon panther teeth from the fading corpses.

### Combat: Shadow Golems

As the panthers died, two large shadow golems emerged from the pit, walking on air. The party identified them through knowledge checks:

**Shadow Golem Abilities (identified):**
- From Nidel (neighboring necromantic nation)
- Immune to cold
- Infinite spell resistance (automatically resist spells with SR)
- Resist physical attacks except adamantine slashing weapons
- Shadow aura: absorbs light to dim within 60 feet
- Can air walk while shadow aura is active
- Vulnerability: Light/dark descriptor spells can suppress their aura
- Fast healing from shadow conjuration/evocation spells
- Sunbeam and Sunburst do d8s instead of d6s
- Searing Light slows them (no save)
- Fortitude saves cause strength damage on failed saves

**Combat Progression:**
- Liana shot Golem A with electrical arrows for 56 damage (the golem resisted some damage)
- Luther flurried Golem A using his fire-enhanced fists for 153 damage total (with shattering punch and fire elemental fury), destroying it
- The destruction of Golem A caused the area to brighten as its shadow aura ended
- Yzma used her Gem of Brightness light ray on Golem B, suppressing its shadow aura and slowing it
- The slow prevented attacks of opportunity
- Golem B attacked Liana for 30 damage and inflicted blindness (permanent, failed fortitude saves)

**Retreat:**
Through knowledge checks, the party realized the golems would return to their original positions if the party retreated from the area. Yzma called for retreat. Liana, now blind, attempted to use a wand of Cure Light Wounds but the magic failed due to the necrotic blindness effect also blocking magical healing.

Luther destroyed the remaining golem with a final flurry, dealing 162 damage.

### Investigation of the Golems

After combat, Yzma examined the golems and discovered:
- Both bore the insignia of the **Ilvarandi family** from **Nidel**
- The Ilvarandi family is pro-Thrune but not closely allied enough to freely give such valuable constructs
- Yzma theorized that Barzillai Thrune (or a close associate) must have personally persuaded them to loan the golems
- The shadow golems made sense as guardians for a soul-bound phylactery - they require no food or maintenance and attack obediently
- The demon panthers were likely unrelated to the golems, probably native to this area of the Underdark

### Return to Kintargo and Healing

Unable to remove Liana's blindness with their available magic, the party teleported back to Kintargo. They visited the **Temple of Shelae** (the "hippie temple"):

- The priests agreed to perform a ritual to remove the blindness for a donation of 1,000 gold pieces
- The hour-long ritual involved:
  - Liana spinning a device called a "scolopokide" (colored spinning goggles)
  - Priests chanting in a circle on beanbags
  - Passing around a substance that induced altered states
  - Luther refused to participate, being immune to the effects due to Diamond Body
  - Yzma joined the chanting and passed a fortitude save

The ritual successfully removed the blindness and the necrotic effect preventing magical healing.

### Additional Healing and Rest

- Liana donated 300 gold for additional healing
- Luther donated 10 gold for minimal healing (receiving only 13 HP)
- The party returned to their base at the Lucky Bones
- They rested for a full day to recover spells and hit points

### Treasure Division

The party divided the dragon hoard four ways (Luther, Liana, Yzma, and the absent Max):
- 17,875 gp per person (from the gold coins)
- 1,325 pp per person (13,250 gp equivalent)
- 13,500 gp in gems per person
- Total per person: approximately 44,625 gp equivalent

Luther expressed interest in eventually purchasing the Lucky Bones property.

## COMBAT ENCOUNTERS

### Shadow Demon Panthers (4)
- **Result:** Victory
- **Tactics:** Panthers used cone of cold breath weapons; party used fire damage effectively
- **Casualties:** None (Liana blinded later by golem)
- **Notable:** Panthers were vulnerable to fire and fled when ignited

### Shadow Golems (2)
- **Source:** Ilvarandi family of Nidel
- **Result:** Victory
- **Tactics:** Golems used shadow aura to dim light, claw attacks, and strength-draining shadows
- **Casualties:** Liana suffered permanent blindness (later cured)
- **Damage Taken:**
  - Luther: 51 damage from one golem, 4 points of strength damage
  - Liana: 30 damage, permanent blindness requiring temple healing
  - Yzma: 59 damage from golem claws
- **Notable:** Suppressing shadow aura with light spells slowed the golems and prevented attacks of opportunity

## IMPORTANT DIALOGUE AND REVELATIONS

### Dragon Bones
- The elder red dragon died from lightning damage, which is unusual for red dragons
- The dragon's death occurred some time ago (bones are old)
- The scattered humanoid bones in the rage chamber were fresh enough to have decaying flesh when they were torn apart

### Ilvarandi Family Connection
- The shadow golems bear the Ilvarandi family crest from Nidel
- The Ilvarandi family is pro-Thrune but not closely allied
- Someone (likely Barzillai Thrune himself or a close associate like Barzillai) must have personally persuaded them to loan these valuable constructs
- This suggests the soul-bound phylactery is extremely important to Thrune

### Temple of Shelae
- The party has established a pattern of only visiting for paid services, never making charitable donations
- The priests use altered-state rituals involving substances and meditation for their magic
- Their healing magic is effective despite their unorthodox methods

---

## UNRESOLVED THREADS

1. **Primary Quest:** The soul-bound phylactery containing Thrune's heart has not yet been found, though Yzma continues to feel pulled toward it deeper in the caverns

2. **Dragon's Death:** The cause of the elder red dragon's death by lightning remains unexplained - what killed it?

3. **Rage Chamber Mystery:** Who or what tore apart the humanoid victims in the rage chamber? The dragon was already dead, so it wasn't responsible

4. **Shadow Golem Purpose:** Why were such valuable constructs placed here specifically? What are they guarding?

5. **Demon Panther Origin:** Were the demon panthers native to this area or placed here intentionally?

6. **Unexplored Areas:** The party retreated before fully exploring the deeper caverns beyond the golem encounter

7. **Missing Party Member:** Max (the cleric) was absent due to family obligations - the party plans to either continue without him or bring the fighter Hero as a substitute tank

8. **Dragon Hoard Remaining:** The party noted the location of the hoard but didn't take everything - they may return for more items later

9. **Ilvarandi Family:** This connection to Nidel could have diplomatic or political implications later
