Speaker 1
Yeah, right. You guys wasted pretty much no time getting yourselves to hell.

Speaker 2
Uh-huh.

Speaker 1
Teleported to the base of the Bone Tower in the Rib Causeway, where you were greeted by Orgarthan, a pit fiend, who gave you a few instructions on the rules of your activities within the bone tower, bone spire. The shard of Sargato's teacup was traded for some extra information. Um, not very much extra information, but there are a few undamned souls in this tower that can be freed. And he assured you that you would know them when you've met them. You enter the Hall of Penitence, the first layer of the tower, where Max took on the cruelty flaw from Brazali Thrunsins. And you guys fought a pair of Warmonger Guardians who were pretty quickly dispatched. Although they did get some nice crits on you. The lucky rolls. Particularly you, I think. Yeah. I don't know if I hit Luthor as well.

Speaker 2
Well, they died before Luthor got hit.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay. Nope. Oh, that's right. I was going to crit you and then you tumbled through. Correct. That was... That. pair of crits that almost got here. You guys then went to the far end of the penitence, and entered the northernmost chamber, or, uh, portal, where Yzma took on the flaw of gynophobia, um, weakening through as Tower Rumbles in frustration. You guys found yourselves in a bathhouse, where it's on the map, where you met a... ...fei creature.

Speaker 3
A good water demon.

Speaker 1
I don't know if you guys ever identified it. Because... Yeah. Yeah, we said it was a water demon.

Speaker 2
Yeah, we did identify it.

Speaker 1
I wasn't sure if anyone actually had knowledge of nature. Narsperia?

Speaker 2
That sound right? That was her. She knows things. Unlike the rest of our Sarasods. I have knowledge, I got last level.

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. Finally got some religion in the cleric. At level 17. Yeah, that. Thank you. She informed you guys that she had been captured a creature of fire and metal and forced to sing a certain song whenever the lyre starts playing on the statue there. And it made Thrun unhappy. It, yeah, it tormented Thrun. Like I said. We did it for his own good. We took the lyre and started playing a tune, we'll be generous and say a tune.

Speaker 2
Yeah, he played something.

Speaker 1
It was a tomb. He tried. Maybe discordant, but it was a tomb. And she sang the Song of Silver, which caused the tower again to rumble in frustration and pain. And then Thrun's voice cried out. And then Max's clean-shifted her? or returned to her. Plane shifted her to. You didn't send her to the plane of water, though?

Speaker 4
You sent her to the material plane?

Speaker 1
Yeah, I sent her to the Citargo Bay.

Speaker 4
Okay. Now, if that has a 94% accuracy within 20 miles, should we determine whether she actually made it or not? Yeah, she ended up farther out at sea, I think. Oh, that's right.

Speaker 2
So, of all the places to fail at, that's not so bad.

Speaker 1
I mean, yeah, considering Ravenel is mostly surrounded by water on all sides, She had pretty, uh...

Speaker 2
Well, it wasn't 20 miles. It was 500 miles. But either way... And the material point is better than hell.

Speaker 1
Yes. Agreed. Anyone should agree with this, except for probably devils. I don't know that they would disagree. And even then, they might debate it.

Speaker 2
They'll debate just about anything. In case... And that is where we left off. Yeah. Yeah, I think our next step was to figure out which to go through one of the two doors here. So who wants the curse?

Speaker 1
There's a north door and a south door. Or you could go back the way you came. Because there were two more doors the way we came. There's two more doors in the hall of penance. There's two doors here in the bathhouse.

Speaker 2
I don't have a strong field either way.

Speaker 3
Portals, right.

Speaker 2
Who wants to go witchcraft? Who wants to take the... The curse?

Speaker 3
I'll take this one. Okay.

Speaker 4
Okay, so north door it is. Is this similar to those levels in Super Mario Bros. back in the day where the dungeon just wouldn't end? Like, you kept going through different doors?

Speaker 2
Well, I think eventually we'll get to the end of it. Statistically. Well, we just don't know. Statistically, something will happen. Well, I mean, there's always so many. We know that. We do know there's, what, nine? He said? Nine.

Speaker 1
Nine floors.

Speaker 2
Yeah. So, we may have to find...

Speaker 3
The ninth floor is... Yeah, that's right. Is the roof. The eighth is the roof.

Speaker 1
The ninth is the roof.

Speaker 3
Is it? Yeah. Okay, cool. Because we're taking 8 sins up.

Speaker 2
Yep. Not sure how there's 8 rather than 7, but whatever. Don't care. Oh, these are mortal flaws. Mortal flaws, not deadly sins.

Speaker 4
Is it European floors or American floors? Do they start at 0 or start at 1? Yes. I don't even know.

Speaker 1
Definitely. They're actually hell floors, so they actually start at negative 300. Start at 13. Jump up another 32.

Speaker 4
I'd like to go to 4LL, please.

Speaker 1
Okay, see ya. Welcome to the lower level, pal. It might take a while.

Speaker 2
It's a godly lower. That's just a never-ending elevator. That's the torture. And of course, the song never ends. It's the one that's played as elevator.

Speaker 4
It never gets to the last part of the chorus that you're waiting for. The part that you can actually sing along with. Uh-oh.

Speaker 2
It changes what it ends each time, just slightly. I know this part. It goes, oh. Oh, the part you enjoy seeing? No, I can't do that. So, uh.

Speaker 1
It's the part that you actually know when it's just nails on a chalkboard. They would do that. So you're going through the northern or southern part? Northern one. Northern one. We'll need...

Speaker 2
Come over here for a sec. *Sings* number X.

Speaker 1
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. Luther gets this one. Luther. Should be a saving throw. Don't know what it is yet. Yep. You'll need a fortitude saving throw except for Luther who's willingly taking this. - Yes.

Speaker 5
- 42, 42. - Where is my 42?

Speaker 2
- 27.

Speaker 3
- 27. I wasted the best roll I could make. - You just did the best roll. - I thought I still needed the roll. - Wait, is this a fortitude we're doing? - Yeah. - I thought I still needed the roll.

Speaker 5
- I just rolled a one, but I get plus 10, just so you know.

Speaker 2
- Okay, so fail.

Speaker 5
- Yep.

Speaker 2
- Well, it would have failed either way at that point. - 22 for me.

Speaker 1
All right. I still get to save the damage though. Luther takes 24 points of... Sorry, you have resisted this. 12 points of fire damage and 12 points of unholy damage. Same with Lyanna. You guys take 6 of each.

Speaker 5
12, say that again, 12 and what?

Speaker 1
12 points of fire, 12 points of unholy. You resist the first 30 fire.

Speaker 2
12 points of damage. 6. Just take the 12 points of unholy.

Speaker 1
All of you witness Rosalie being severely beaten as a child by his mother with a flail after she caught him spying on his sister while she bathed. Luther, you get minus two on your will saves.

Speaker 3
Oh no. Those were my best.

Speaker 1
Does anyone need a reminder of their penalties from last week?

Speaker 2
No, I got it. I have minus two to my fourth seed.

Speaker 1
What did I have? You haven't taken any sense yet. Applause.

Speaker 4
Does it continue for every four for the rest of us? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 1
They continue while you're in hell.

Speaker 2
The beatings will continue until morale improves.

Speaker 1
Does anyone need a little healing? Find location. I can use that, please. Hold on, before you get into that. The gleaming white of this chamber, white walls, makes the rivets, red trickling down their surfaces, all the more dramatic. I'm just gonna make sure I'm describing the right place. The coppery stink of blood hangs heavily in the air. That is not a very good description. Just tell me what that big ol' glowing thing in the middle is.

Speaker 2
The light source.

Speaker 1
The light source.

Speaker 2
I'm sure it's safe. Could not hurt a fly. Yep. Because there's no flies here.

Speaker 4
Only red herrings are put on the map.

Speaker 1
Which are fish out of the water, I suppose. The damned tormented in this room are those who, through pregnancy or desire to care for children or family members, neglected their duty to Brazali Thrun as ruthless soldiers, guardians, or inquisitors. His resentment for their choices has inflated and distorted by the fear and hatred he felt towards his own parents. And you guys totally understand that. Tell me about your mother. I can understand your parents. They exist as children who are brutally punished and repeated for minor mistakes.

Speaker 2
Why did they beat with a flail though? So probably plus to them.

Speaker 1
It was a flogger, not a flail. So in this chamber, the northern chamber, the damned are our children being brutally punished and repeatedly for minor mistakes. where there's a southern chamber, aside with the curtains. Damn souls are forced to toil at classic child labor tasks, scrubbing the floors with poisonous chemicals, cleaning smoldering chimneys, and foul chamber pots, grinding clockwork parts with their bare hands.

Speaker 4
is funny. Harvesting hard to reach bitter berries from vicious thorny plants. So if any of us need to use the bathroom, now is the time. All the beans you've been saving up? There

Speaker 3
are. So I just want to make sure that human beans, the worst kind of beans. I want to make that I understood this right, there are actually children being tortured here. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4
That's not right to me.

Speaker 1
They are all children. Only children are being tortured here actually. How does that work with innocence? That's where I'm going with this. Only children get to suffer because Brazal is a dick. Oh yeah. And hell is even more of a dick.

Speaker 2
No, I just didn't know how innocence worked in the D&D methodology, or in the Pathfinder mythology with regards to children.

Speaker 1
I mean, it could be evil. Do you have knowledge of religion? Yeah, I do!

Speaker 2
What does the 22 tell me?

Speaker 1
22? Yeah, I rolled really uncharacteristically good. Anyone can commit sins at any time in their life.

Speaker 2
Okay. Fair enough. Sinners!

Speaker 1
With that said, children have a lot less of a lifespan to get condemned than, you know, normal mortals, given their span of life.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 4
I was going to say, having been pushed into a locker or two in my youth, yeah, kids can be dicks.

Speaker 5
I think they're pushing to a locker. There are...

Speaker 2
Ah, overseers or something.

Speaker 5
Yes.

Speaker 3
My favorite saying I came up with a long time ago was, "There's nothing dumber than a ten-year-old boy. There's nothing meaner than a ten-year-old girl."

Speaker 4
Oh my god, they're so cute. Girls are horrible.

Speaker 2
That's very true.

Speaker 5
Should have heard the ones that go in Oregon. There are. But hurting children are practically not okay.

Speaker 2
What appear to be nuns. Ah, nuns. What are they actually according to his site?

Speaker 5
How can you have any pussy if you don't eat your meat?

Speaker 1
Ursula? Dressed as a nun? They look evil to me. Yeah, no, they're physically dressed as nuns, but they have like the... Ursula from Little Mermaid. They're just dressed as nuns. Ursula from Little Mermaid.

Speaker 3
They're cosplaying as nuns.

Speaker 1
That one is whipping the children and that one is forcing the kids to do the tedious tasks that cause physical playing. Or is this a... I still haven't come to that part. I think it's just the light source.

Speaker 3
I'm trying to figure it out.

Speaker 1
You should definitely touch it.

Speaker 5
I touched the butt.

Speaker 1
When I draw on the map, somebody dripped a bit of honey It's a large yellow crystal that resembles an immense crystallized heart. Oh. It's all the pulsates the room with light. But makes no sound. Weird. So there's no thump-thump. Yeah, it just pulsates the room with light.

Speaker 2
Okay. Well. How dare they torment children like that?

Speaker 3
Oh, they dare. They did it. Is there a way to... See if the children are evil or...

Speaker 2
Yeah, I can look at it and see. I'm looking at the children right now. Are they evil? No. Okay, children aren't evil. Those nuns are.

Speaker 3
They're not super evil. I got that part. I think I can feel that.

Speaker 2
Yeah, the children are not evil.

Speaker 4
Does that mean we have to save the children?

Speaker 5
I don't know. I don't know how old you can. Do we donate money for that?

Speaker 4
That's Sally Struthers or whoever it is.

Speaker 5
For only the price of a cup of coffee, you'd save an entire village.

Speaker 3
For just 12 cents a day. All of a sudden you hear wings of an angel. You can't. I'm so excited.

Speaker 1
One in the northern room. Turns to you guys as she's flogging this child.

Speaker 2
Is her comment, do you mind? I'm busy here.

Speaker 5
Busy.

Speaker 2
Come back later.

Speaker 1
And smiles broadly at you, greeting you as she whips a child. That's not nice. Well, hello there. How are you guys today? A little perturbing. The scrims of the children are echoing throughout this chamber.

Speaker 3
A little perturbed.

Speaker 1
So it's like Tempo of Doom, essentially, right? The lower caverns? Yes.

Speaker 3
How far away am I from it? There. The one in the odd. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, forty. Hey, that's exactly the magic number I need. Hi. So, yeah. Well, hello there. Oh, boy. literally it's like the lukeh flying kick the bicycle kick of justice which one which one does just the flying kick the one that just goes

Speaker 4
straight but not but he does the bicycle oh he does oh yeah yeah just the one that it's like

Speaker 3
rayton does the fist first yeah the movie star guy what was his name he does a shadow kick he's kind of slides across the ground. Anyway, I know one of them does like a fucking like a jet cake. He's like, jumps straight up and shoots across. That's what I'm doing, essentially. Okay, well, I guess we're rolling initiative now.

Speaker 2
I mean, not surprised.

Speaker 1
Ah! You remember that sometimes you can talk, too. What? We are!

Speaker 2
We were.

Speaker 1
There was a conversation

Speaker 2
that could have happened. We are using the universal language.

Speaker 4
Luther's special language.

Speaker 3
Luther only knows one language.

Speaker 2
He knows one language. I know one language.

Speaker 3
I speak them all.

Speaker 1
So Luther, is that a standard action to do that? Or is that a full round action? That is the beginning of a flurry. So you don't get the surprise round off. Because you can only do standard action or move action during the surprise round. But, that's okay. With that said, initiative. And not to dev. As everyone like, just looks at Luther who already is floating in the air. Just waiting to get catapulted at this creature.

Speaker 2
That looks about right. That looks about right.

Speaker 1
That seems right.

Speaker 4
Slow motion. Mid-sentence. Luther's foot passes you.

Speaker 2
No, my surprise round action was hitting him with the wand of healing. For six hit points.

Speaker 4
Thank you.

Speaker 2
Going around the circle.

Speaker 4
14.

Speaker 5
26.

Speaker 1
Large amount. 6. 6. 24. 24.

Speaker 5
I mean, it's not a surprise. I think it'll be somebody in that.

Speaker 1
Here's the awkward thing. So Luther starts floating like he's about to catapult himself through the air at this thing. And Liana, you react even quicker than that.

Speaker 5
As he's running and sees the air, I'll shoot past his head.

Speaker 1
He's done like a... And as he does this motion, you're like, oh, that's the go button.

Speaker 5
Do I saw that reaction thing?

Speaker 2
I don't know.

Speaker 5
I don't remember what it was. When I was able to cast haste on people.

Speaker 2
Oh, you have your rod. You don't need to necessarily do haste this turn if you don't want to. No, but it helps. It does help. You can only do that three times a day though.

Speaker 5
So I only got it once. So you could do it again. Alright, let's do that again. Okay, so swift action, Spence. So now I'm going to haste it too.

Speaker 3
So, in my mid jump, I go faster.

Speaker 5
Adzie's like...

Speaker 1
And a long parallel of the arrows that she does.

Speaker 2
There's just a whole swarm of arrows following it. And I get it slightly ahead of her.

Speaker 4
That's right, you can long jump at a standstill, right? Yes. That's right.

Speaker 3
Jump kick. That's what you were running. The whole of it, the rule is, it has to be within my bonus movement area, which is 40. So that's the magic number.

Speaker 1
I should have put her one square away. One more square that way and it would have countered this entire endeavor. Well, until I... Postpone this entire endeavor.

Speaker 4
By a round.

Speaker 2
No, not even...

Speaker 4
Possibly even a conversation. Oh, that's true.

Speaker 2
Well, I mean, I could have just put my hand on his shoulder and put us both in front of her. Well, hello!

Speaker 3
Oh. Well, it was the well hello while whipping a child. That's what got me. That's what got you?

Speaker 1
That was the draw? Yep.

Speaker 2
The whipping the child probably just doesn't go over well with most of the party. For some strange or noble reason.

Speaker 1
Who cares about strange or noble reason? Luther, you're on deck. I didn't say noble. I said I'm noble. I am too.

Speaker 5
Hold on.

Speaker 1
Yeah. I'm just letting Luther know that he's going to start. Oh, shit. We got to go higher.

Speaker 5
Great.

Speaker 4
You're on deck on deck. I'll speak as I see him jumping forward. I'll just say, I'm sorry about what's about to happen. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1
Sorry about this. What about what? It's like 72 arrows and 13 fists. I don't think he has 72 fists, but sometimes it feels like that.

Speaker 2
Flying fists are fury.

Speaker 4
As a mortal human, in reality, I would say one arrow probably feels like a thousand arrows. Are they evil? Oh, yes.

Speaker 5
I figured as much, but I have to ask. So make sure I roll properly.

Speaker 2
Oh, yeah. They're even evil outsiders, which I'm a big fan of. Killing.

Speaker 1
I'm a big fan of killing.

Speaker 2
I'm a big fan of killing, too, but... No, no, I have Bane on my weapon. That's why I say that. Strange enough, my weapon doesn't... They don't like my weapon here for some completely understandable reason.

Speaker 1
Your holy Bane weapon? No, I don't think that... Or is it not holy?

Speaker 2
Do evil outsider. It's not holy.

Speaker 1
I mean, holy plus thing.

Speaker 2
No, no, just evil.

Speaker 1
Oh, is that holy?

Speaker 5
Do I wrote planes if I want to know if I know anything about them? Sure.

Speaker 1
You can just... You're like, oh! Oh, yeah, they're immune to arrows.

Speaker 5
No, it's more the electric fire holding... Electric has been pretty good.

Speaker 2
Electric fire.

Speaker 5
Electric fire holding.

Speaker 2
Electric shoes are a pretty good choice.

Speaker 5
20.

Speaker 1
20?

Speaker 5
Yep. Don't know.

Speaker 1
3. Uh, hand-rated devil.

Speaker 5
Okay. I don't know much about him, huh?

Speaker 1
Uh. It's alright.

Speaker 5
I'll still do electro.

Speaker 1
Like all devils, they're immune to fire and poison. Like a lot of high-ranking devils, they resist physical attacks. Uh, like almost all devils. I think almost all devils. Resist acid and cold. They resist spells. They have a number of spell-like abilities.

Speaker 5
We'll stick with electric.

Speaker 1
And their biggest scary thing is that they can bring someone to hell with them. Well, since they're already in hell, that ability is far less intimidating.

Speaker 3
They can take us to double hell.

Speaker 1
Double hell. Sure. Yeah, if they grapple someone, they can actually transport themselves and set grapple a person to hell. Oh no! Yeah. It's a lot more intimidating on your rules.

Speaker 3
I totally forgot.

Speaker 5
Let's start at the top.

Speaker 3
That we could be playing Tenacious D in every battle.

Speaker 5
Alright, what hits? 46?

Speaker 3
46? Yeah, 46 hits.

Speaker 5
44?

Speaker 1
Yep.

Speaker 5
37?

Speaker 1
Yep.

Speaker 5
37?

Speaker 1
Yep.

Speaker 5
42?

Speaker 1
Yep. I'll hit it.

Speaker 5
Now for the damage.

Speaker 1
And what kind of damages are you doing?

Speaker 5
I'm doing the regular with the evil opposite and then the...

Speaker 2
So they're holy weapon?

Speaker 5
Yeah. And the elemental is electric.

Speaker 2
Okay. So they're good aligned and...

Speaker 5
Yep.

Speaker 2
With the electrical... And a minimal plus three. So they're cold iron good or whatever. Or silver good. Whichever is more relevant. Okay. Give me the damage.

Speaker 5
I'm working on it. I have a... 181. That's a lot of damage.

Speaker 1
Okay. 181. Luther. Is there anything left for me? Oh yeah. She's still standing. Okay. You brutally murdered the shit out of this thing because Because it only had six HP left. Okay.

Speaker 5
When I ask if there's anything left.

Speaker 3
There was something left. My question was. You finish that real quick. Does a 23 hit? No. I'm pretty sure. No. But all six of my other attacks did. Yeah, that was a. So we'll just go with 12.

Speaker 4
So there's a bloody paste on the floor and you're continually punching this bloody paste.

Speaker 3
I'm pretty sure I, like, just the flying kick in just did it in him.

Speaker 1
I wouldn't just... Yeah, there used to be a chest cavity. There's a foot there now. Mm-hmm. And the heart is here.

Speaker 3
With the opening attack, I do a minimum of 12 damage. A minimum of 12. Yeah, that was me looking at it. Funny, I guess.

Speaker 1
Funny enough! The actual rest of the flurry was you just trying to get your foot back out of the chest cavity. As your leg went wholly through this creature.

Speaker 5
Do you need a napkin?

Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am. Can we see this one? Can she see us? You can see it through the clear crystal, so it's distorted. Like looking through a giant crystal would look like. Fair. That pulse lights. That's over there. Hey, there's a bunch of children in here doing painful tasks like collecting berries from thorny bushes.

Speaker 3
That's so mean.

Speaker 4
I'm going to actually yell out to this one down there. Hey, I'd stop that if I were you. I would not. Please stop that.

Speaker 5
Your stupid elf is going to probably try to shoot you next. You might want to stop.

Speaker 4
With a 40 on the diplomacy. We're going to go diplomacy first. Please stop. Otherwise, we have to kill you. So that's it. Okay. I don't feel like I need to waste magic on the things that you guys are... turning into pulp.

Speaker 2
Oh, another one.

Speaker 4
Third one comes up from that third... Like, wiping its hands, it's a bathroom, and it's like...

Speaker 1
It's like, oh man, torturing children is so much fuck.

Speaker 4
Still got a little bib on that shows a silhouette of a crab. Eat that, Joe.

Speaker 5
Are you cold? Do you really need this? No. Okay. Hmm.

Speaker 1
How about make a perception check? Yes. 45? Yes.

Speaker 5
30.

Speaker 1
26.

Speaker 5
Unless it's trap-finding, in which case it's 4.

Speaker 1
I rolled 1.

Speaker 5
Evil Outsiders plus 4.

Speaker 1
So everyone but Luthor hears a voice from that chamber that that one came out of. What did it say? Some weird chant. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3
I rolled a 1, so 32. Also Luthor. I'm a perceptive asshole.

Speaker 2
Hey, your perception's right around mine. I think it's actually barely mine, finally. I just haven't been upgrading it much, because it's hardly worth it. I just do it because... What else? Right. I have the exact opposite problem, where I have almost no skill points, so...

Speaker 4
I wasn't going to start something new. That's the whole thing. That's right. That was a red-green thing, right? If the women don't find you pretty, They find you perceptive? Right. Handy. Handy.

Speaker 2
Handy. That's right.

Speaker 5
Perceptive.

Speaker 2
Something is happening. Don't know what the thing is happening. Yeah, I don't know the spell off the top of it. It's not exactly how it works. Okay. We're being spelled.

Speaker 1
Is it a wheel safe?

Speaker 2
No. They're sending us to hell. Hmm.

Speaker 5
They're going whether we like it or not. In a hand basket. I draw the basket! I draw the basket. I tell it important to hear. Where are we? Why are we in this basket?

Speaker 2
And then they dismiss the lust. Go home!

Speaker 3
That's honestly the best.

Speaker 2
It does mean all the dismissal type spells I have prepped are pretty useless, because banishment doesn't do a whole hell of a lot here. Go home! I'm already there!

Speaker 4
He merely appears one room over.

Speaker 2
He just appears.

Speaker 4
Back in the bathroom.

Speaker 1
Aww. There's another occupied, occupied. Aww. Usually it's a done, they're gone. What is your CMD, Luther? Wait a minute.

Speaker 3
What do we see? Crazy. 48. I told you it was something crazy.

Speaker 2
Monk.

Speaker 1
So a bunch of tentacles that happen to be black start surrounding you and attempting to grab you. And you don't seem to notice. Are you dancing with them?

Speaker 4
Yeah. Swatting away like mosquitoes. Like I was saying.

Speaker 2
What is that? What is that? I'm figuring they're swiping at him and he's literally dancing along with them. Using your dance moves.

Speaker 1
You can dance if you want to. You can leave your friends behind. Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance,

Speaker 2
no friends are mine. So who cast that one? The one who walked through the door?

Speaker 1
The one that walked in the door.

Speaker 2
She's like, "Oh, fuck!"

Speaker 1
Tentacles.

Speaker 2
I explained devils a lot. The devil thing.

Speaker 1
I'm going to need a... We'll say...

Speaker 4
20.

Speaker 1
20. The other devil that you're like, hey, don't do anything. You feel some mental influence coming at you, but then you're like, no, what did I tell you?

Speaker 4
Spellcraft. 20 also.

Speaker 1
20? Dominate person.

Speaker 2
Oh. As you do. They're used to that spell. Worse, grow their children.

Speaker 4
Alright, well, my turn will be a little dominating in return.

Speaker 1
Um, that makes it max finally. Okay. There's a bunch of tentacles in the floor.

Speaker 2
Yeah, that would be a problem for someone else. Hi!

Speaker 5
So much for their concentration.

Speaker 2
What concentration? I don't know. Oh, I rolled really poorly. 35?

Speaker 1
35 to hit?

Speaker 2
Yeah. I don't want to assume.

Speaker 1
Yeah, that hits.

Speaker 2
Okay, good. I'm only getting one hit though. So I'm going to 12 to 8. 12 to 6. 8. 10. 12.

Speaker 1
You can dance.

Speaker 2
And every evil outsider.

Speaker 1
Yeah, and your damage is...

Speaker 2
Plus 5 equal to 1. Okay.

Speaker 1
Any element? No, elemental force. It's just an axe. The element of slashing your face off.

Speaker 2
Unfortunately, 5-6 got me 5 here. 10, 20, 30, 41. 41 plus 36 is... 41 plus... 40 plus 37 is 77 damage. 77? And did I have anything else I wanted to do with this one? Yeah, 77 sounds... You know what? I'll do that too. Swift action 4, so yeah. And I need to make a 4-2 save.

Speaker 1
And so DC?

Speaker 2
21. I do need a real spell resistance, but I can't fail, so... That's what you're doing. I didn't roll one. Any total? Dear God. 35, 40?

Speaker 1
Yeah, that's a wonderful piece.

Speaker 2
No, I get to add most of my level to it. What was the... A second time. Fortitude? 21. You said? Yep.

Speaker 1
Where is your saves, you stupid punk?

Speaker 2
Because it's only a forceful strike. 21? Yeah. Okay, and it passes? Okay, that means it only takes half the damage. Half the 10 die 6 extra. Or 10 die 4 extra. I'll just roll 5 and double it. Or 5 and take the full... Whatever. 2... 5... 9 damage.

Speaker 1
9 damage not halved?

Speaker 2
9 damage not halved.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
Rather than 10 die 4 hour roll, 5 die 4. Like I said, not doing a whole lot with it. I was hoping to blast them across the room. Because that's half the fun.

Speaker 1
Half the fun is just not... Is it a bull rush thing? Where they actually like fly?

Speaker 2
Yeah, basically it's... You hit them with a melee weapon. You deal normal damage, but you also deal additional damage equal to 1 die 4 bucks cash flow up to 10 die 4. I determine if they're pushed, make a combat maneuver check. I did not like this. Make a combat maneuver check. I don't move as part of it, but I have to push them back if I defeat their CMD. Oh, you didn't do that. A successful fortune halves the damage and negates the push.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay, that's part. I'm waiting for the part where they actually negated that part. Halves the damage. Yeah, it makes it... It's never actually been useful. Like, instinctively, as you hit it, all of its tentacle legs, like, suction itself to the ground. And it just goes... I mean, it only took 85 damage. Yeah, it did a lot of damage, but... Yeah. Instinctively, all those tentacle feet really helped it out there.

Speaker 2
Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1
As it...

Speaker 2
It was going to work the whole spell.

Speaker 1
It was kind of a...

Speaker 2
Why not use it? Level of spell. Back to the top of the round.

Speaker 1
Lyanna.

Speaker 5
Yep. Do I have to go around the reacher? Or do I attack the tentacle things?

Speaker 2
There's nothing to attack with the tentacle things. Make a spellcraft check. You probably know that if you roll too.

Speaker 5
This is kind of hilarious. 36.

Speaker 1
The tentacles are immune to damage.

Speaker 5
Okay. Then I won't bother with them.

Speaker 1
And they also provide cover.

Speaker 5
Okay. So, do I have to go around to reach?

Speaker 2
I mean, you could walk over here and shoot this one.

Speaker 5
Yeah, that's the best choice. Sorry, Luther. You're on your own.

Speaker 2
I don't think he's suffering.

Speaker 1
We'll get you yet.

Speaker 3
I only got one shot. I got one cool magic item.

Speaker 2
You only get one shot here.

Speaker 5
Okay, can I move?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 5
Do I get the haste still?

Speaker 2
Nope. You just moved a very small portion of your movement speed. I don't know how that works. Probe droid. How do you move a little? I know.

Speaker 3
At this point, a small punch of my movement speed is like 80.

Speaker 5
Does 37 hit?

Speaker 3
Yep. So what does haste do?

Speaker 2
Does it give you like extra attack at your full base attack force? Push 30 hit, push 30, push extra movement speed. 30, so. So you're... You're... You're... 111.

Speaker 5
35? Or 110?

Speaker 2
Yeah, mine's only 70. Unfortunately, they put all these small doors in this place. Did you just say a number? 35. 35? What's the damage? Okay. 35 to hit 35 damage?

Speaker 5
37 to hit 35 damage.

Speaker 2
Ah, close. I know it's not even close to that, but you know what? Not even close. I mean, it's not... Not nothing. Not nothing, and... It's not as healthy as it used to be before you guys came in. Yeah, I mean, and it's welcome to cast offensively or fail. Because if it doesn't cast offensively, I'll be happy to help it make a check.

Speaker 1
We'll see what Luthor... Oh, Luthor's not going to be fighting that one, so... No, no, no. He has his own target to murder.

Speaker 3
Do I see anyone sitting here? So it's crazy enough.

Speaker 2
Uh, no.

Speaker 3
Crazy enough is too far away for me to do what I want to do.

Speaker 1
So, tentacles are difficult terrain. Yep, it's 45. So, tentacles are difficult terrain.

Speaker 3
Yeah. So, anyway. So, anyway. Yeah, so, anyway. So, anyway, start blasting. So, yeah, I'll just run up and I'm going to do something that I haven't done once before and it failed. So, I'm going to do it again. Is that in fist? Yeah, why not?

Speaker 2
Well, it doesn't take us action. It's just saying, I want to do it.

Speaker 3
Yeah, because I only get one punch.

Speaker 2
What? What? No, you don't.

Speaker 3
Yeah, it's a standard action.

Speaker 1
I just looked at this literally. Stunny piss? Yeah. It's a standard action.

Speaker 3
What on earth? I was looking at it literally Thursday. And I can't flurry. I can't flurry now, so, because I move.

Speaker 2
No, you. Wait, hold on. No, no, it's just you declare it before using it. That's the only requirement. It doesn't. But I can't use it in a flurry. Yeah, you can. No. You need to declare it before you use it. That's the only limitation here. I was... I know, I know. I looked it up on Thursday because we thought it was so freaking useless. You must declare it before you use this feat before you make your attack roll. Starring fist forces damage by your unarmed attack to make a forward tooth safe. In addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails to save is stunned for a round. A stunned character drops everything, can't do a whole bunch of stuff, yadda yadda yadda. You make a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained, but no more than once a round. That's the only limitation. It's not a standard action. Use it. It's just you declare part of your...

Speaker 3
I was under the assumption that it was a standard attack.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I always thought it was a standard action. Yeah, I was too.

Speaker 3
Because that is literally why I never use it. because you'd rather flurry. But you can't flurry this round anyway.

Speaker 2
Yeah, but no, it's actually just part of your attack. You just decide to do it just like you do your flaming fist. And you have it equal to the number of monk levels you have. Yes.

Speaker 3
So a day, I have 17 of these. Attempts. Attempts a day.

Speaker 2
Who knew?

Speaker 1
Surprise! Who knew? The monk could be more broken. Alright, so roll your attack. What's your whisper?

Speaker 3
What's your wisdom off art? Well, of course you have to hit. Okay. I might not hit. What? I'm fucking 33. Yeah, you hit.

Speaker 2
Wow. 17 divided by 2 is 8. So, 24 DC. Wisdom is 20. What? My wisdom is 20. Oh, so plus 5. So, um, so... What do you see? Ha!

Speaker 1
You know how I was recruiting you guys before? Nat one.

Speaker 3
They're stunned!

Speaker 1
Hold on. Because I am such a frickin' high level... Oh, you're gonna do the lethal one instead? No, he is...

Speaker 3
Oh, damn!

Speaker 5
What?

Speaker 3
Ah, I should have used it. kill

Speaker 1
next time do not through you have an instant kill stunning fist no I got the I got the black palm 5 bit death dodge

Speaker 3
you have quivering palm quivering palm I got it my last thing

Speaker 4
5 point exploding heart

Speaker 3
yes the best part is the best part is it's a delayed kill I can hit him now and walk away and kill him three days later

Speaker 4
Go home, send him a note say hey by the way, you'll be reading this

Speaker 1
By the time you finish this letter your heart will explode Sincerely to Luther Well I guess he was wrong about BUN!

Speaker 3
Five figure death punch But anyway No, because there's other... Yeah, I'll just do with the stunning right now.

Speaker 2
Next time...

Speaker 3
I have like six other things you can add in the stunning now because it's such a high level.

Speaker 2
Oh, the... You're now exhausted? Exhausted, blind... Something. I mean, realistically though, stunned is fantastic in and of itself. Yeah, you're just not doing anything next round.

Speaker 1
Oh, I don't think she'll be... Oh, what was the damage you rolled? Oh, because it still... Someone would hit. Actually hit it. I forgot about that.

Speaker 2
Someone would hit, though.

Speaker 1
What?

Speaker 2
Someone hit. Yeah.

Speaker 1
And no one else is going to be... She was unharmed before this moment.

Speaker 2
Yeah, so she's not going to be hurt badly here.

Speaker 1
No.

Speaker 2
But it's still fun.

Speaker 3
It's not a little amount of damage, so... Yeah, this is kind of a little amount of damage.

Speaker 2
It's only like 50.

Speaker 3
12, 16, 20, 30, 32. 32. Holy magic.

Speaker 1
Holy diver, gonna punch you in the face now. She apparently does not want to

Speaker 4
Yeah, I see that

Speaker 1
No, yeah, at this level

Speaker 3
I get to permanently blind him That's what I'm saying, I know there's something else

Speaker 1
I could be doing it I have a stunning fish and I call it the eye gouge

Speaker 2
Well, I mean That's your first attack on a bird That's freaking amazing Yeah You got plenty.

Speaker 4
I'm just getting, going past, essentially. Can I go in here, or is there, that's... That's solid. That's solid, yeah.

Speaker 2
You can touch it. You can provoke from her. You can touch it. She might have an attack on you. She might bring you to hell.

Speaker 5
Think before you act.

Speaker 3
Yeah, we'll have to use an acrobatics to not provoke. A 20th is actually, you get paralyzed.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I'll give it a try. I'll try acrobatics not to provoke.

Speaker 1
Okay. That'll be...

Speaker 4
Why not?

Speaker 1
Against our CMD.

Speaker 4
Just a straight up acrobatics roll?

Speaker 2
Yep. I can roll acrobatics too. I just don't know how to succeed.

Speaker 4
We'll see.

Speaker 2
25.

Speaker 1
25. All right.

Speaker 4
Surprisingly nimble for a little old lady.

Speaker 1
Nope.

Speaker 4
Oh, never mind.

Speaker 1
You get to stop there as she calls it into you.

Speaker 2
Yeah, you have to beat her CMD. Which kind of falls okay. You can't get happy with your skill hit. Oh.

Speaker 3
What's your AC? Unless you're rocking a 22 in it, just standing there. 31. 31.

Speaker 1
All right, she does not actually hit you. But. Nice stop. So I guess you didn't stop because you didn't hit you. Oh, okay. But if, yeah. She's still got a chance to try. Yeah, if she has combat reflexes, you'll be provoking again. unless you're going to do another acrobatics.

Speaker 2
What are you trying to do?

Speaker 4
Just get over there. You guys got this handled, so it's not like a...

Speaker 2
You can just dimension door.

Speaker 4
I don't want to waste the spells. I don't know what's coming up.

Speaker 1
It's a fourth level spell. So you need to do at least one more acrobatics, or two more if you want to continue moving beyond that point. I mean if you're just double moving...

Speaker 2
And she does have combat expertise. I mean, you're a ref. You're a ref. She also has combat expertise. Yeah, you know.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I'm going to go all the way to here if I can.

Speaker 3
I'm going to need two acrobaticals. Okay. So you strike, you basically tag and you have up to your...

Speaker 4
28. And 24 which 25 failed so the 24.

Speaker 2
They still have to make that change. Yeah, it's a save. I don't care.

Speaker 4
31.

Speaker 2
They throw you it once in the air. You can only have one active at a time. Oh, god. So you can do it and hit.

Speaker 4
Did you hit? Yes.

Speaker 2
Wait, that's... Unless I'm misunderstanding. Because if you do it, they die, or don't die. So she crits you on the final one. You could do it every time you attack. What does her damage do? I can't imagine that's accurate. No. It's all the dice. It would be hilarious. The monk can't have no more than one quivering palm in effect at a time. Okay, so every time you attack, first attack of the...

Speaker 1
Are you quivering, dude? Quivering palm is different than stunning fist.

Speaker 2
No, no, no.

Speaker 1
No, quivering palm is a different...

Speaker 3
- You can't add that.

Speaker 2
- Oh, it's the only attack you're going around.

Speaker 3
- Starting at 15th level, you can use set of vibrations in the body of another to be fatal if the monk so desires. What's even better is they don't... Ah, there it is, once a day. - I thought so, I thought so. I was gonna say, it's good, but I didn't think it was that... - And you must announce his intent before making a tap roll, which is...

Speaker 2
- Fair.

Speaker 3
- So that's a full round action.

Speaker 2
- It is a full round action. So it's super the young master doing it to the poor idiot at the low end of the cultivator school. Take 26 points of damage. And creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Okay.

Speaker 4
26 you said?

Speaker 3
Yep. Oh that doesn't have a grab. Tentacles have grab. Claws do not. And try to make a fortitude save, DC have, plus moon squeeze.

Speaker 4
Yeah, it dies. It's just quadruple moving to get across, so... You die or you don't.

Speaker 1
Trying to get your line of sights.

Speaker 4
This is a double move here. I think it can go up to quadruple, right? No, just double. Just double.

Speaker 2
If you sprint, you can do... But you have to go straight line for a run. There's a portal right there?

Speaker 1
Where? Right there. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Yeah. So you could run through the portal.

Speaker 1
Well, no, I'd have to change directions.

Speaker 2
Well, no, I mean, had she just... Oh, double move? Part of her double move. Oh, and then I jumped out on the head.

Speaker 1
Yeah, but you can sprint at times four.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Straight line.

Speaker 1
Assuming that you're not wearing medium or heavy armor.

Speaker 2
Well, but... I'm good. You can't sprint around angles. She was...

Speaker 1
Here. No, right there. So straight line is pretty straight. Okay, whatever. Yeah, you have another 60 or however many you have, but you're sprinting so it's like a full round action. Yeah, hit the sonic brakes.

Speaker 4
Oh, I'm just double moving.

Speaker 2
Oh, cool. Because that way you're not hurting your AC either. Yeah. Because you'd be flat-footed if you were running, I think, or at least minus two. Flat-footed? Oh, no.

Speaker 3
Oh.

Speaker 2
Oh, damn. You can't be caught flat footed.

Speaker 3
No, I flat foot's the same as my regular. Really?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah, because you can't be caught flat footed. I thought that was the case. You can't be caught flat footed from a visible attacker, but you can still lose your dexterity.

Speaker 3
And if I lose my dexterity, I can be caught flat footed. That's the...

Speaker 2
Yeah, but not for invisible attackers. Yeah. What are invisible attackers? He has true seeing. Yep, yep, yep. But no, that's what I mean. Because you have blind fighting, you can't be caught flat footed from invisible attack. Right. Now, blind fighting gives you the... It just means you're not flat footed against...

Speaker 1
Gives you a second attack. Yes, but it also says you're not flat footed against invisible attackers. So he's double not flat footed against invisible attackers? Well... Triple now that he has double?

Speaker 2
That. Tell you what, you'll make me flatfoot against invisible attackers all day. My AC will change my whole point. By a single whole one point. Because flatfooting for me is not really different at whole. Who's choice?

Speaker 1
It's Zyre's. Yzma.

Speaker 4
I just went?

Speaker 1
Yes. Did she cast? Yzma, you see... What do I see? Children! Three things appear. They look like black feathered angels.

Speaker 2
Ah. We can't see invisible though, right? Oh, you can. Yeah. You can see invisible.

Speaker 4
Not see invisible, I just know something's there.

Speaker 2
Well, no, I mean, it's... Blind sense. I don't think he was... Yeah, so you could actually see if someone is invisible over here. Yeah, if somebody was. Yeah. Just mentioning that, because high-level play is weird.

Speaker 1
You have magic sight. You don't have true sight.

Speaker 2
He has something else, though.

Speaker 4
I have the blind sense, also.

Speaker 2
Blind sense?

Speaker 4
It just detects creatures that are not normally...

Speaker 1
How far does the blind sense go up?

Speaker 4
60 feet, I believe.

Speaker 2
Let me remind myself here. Worth mentioning because it is relevant.

Speaker 4
Blind sense, yeah.

Speaker 1
Blind sense. You sense another creature in that south. Besides those three? Yep, those three just appeared. They were summoned. They were not there, now they are there.

Speaker 4
But then I have also the detect Magic, which I'm assuming everything's magical here.

Speaker 1
There was a blip of conjuration. And then it appeared.

Speaker 2
They've been summoned. For the rest of their lives. I mean, three realms. Ah, something of that nature. One of the two. Same difference.

Speaker 3
You got 16th level. Permanently blind or deafened. Screw you in particular. Or fatigued, sickened, staggered. Staggered is good. The number one throws something at you. What is your touch AC? 22 plus one? Yeah. Everything else... Me? 25. 25?

Speaker 1
Okay. So it throws a rope at you, but just barely misses you. Oop. Oop-dee-doop. Ummmm. Number three. It's going to try the same thing. And misses even worse. Number two. Can you move number two so that I have a line of effect to the third?

Speaker 4
Yep.

Speaker 1
There's a pipe load?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
Okay. Arrows? Then it's going to unleash some arrows. Do you still?

Speaker 3
Oh, fuck yeah! I need arrows. What?

Speaker 1
I need arrows.

Speaker 3
I've taken this so long ago and nobody's ever shot arrows at me. Okay, so... Hold on. I gotta look it up. The first one, do you have deflect arrows? Oh, God, yes. I have the fucking catch and throw it back.

Speaker 2
Oh.

Speaker 3
You have a catch and throw arrow? The, like, improved arrow deflect or whatever. It's fucking awesome.

Speaker 1
Hilarious. Do you want to look this up before I start rolling or after I start rolling?

Speaker 3
I only get the first one. Oh, the first one?

Speaker 2
The first one's automatically dealt with anyways. Okay. Unless they roll that one, which case it's probably not automatically dealt with, because it never went well. What's your receipt?

Speaker 1
Uh... 32. 32. So the first one misses by a lot. The second one misses by less than a lot. 32? Yep. And the third one misses as well. Wow. But since you want to use this ability so much, there were three arrows that whizzed past you. You grabbed one of them that came in. Let's see what happens with this. These arrows are on fire.

Speaker 2
Me? Whatever. What's a little fire?

Speaker 1
He also has a stunned handmaiden devil right in front of him, too.

Speaker 2
I'm just picturing you grabbing the arrow and sticking it there.

Speaker 3
Okay, it doesn't say I can do that, though. Because it says, it's snatch arrows, and it's, when using deflect arrows' feet, you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be, oh, okay, so it's thrown. Oh, uh-huh.

Speaker 2
So you just basically knocked me a moment.

Speaker 1
So I need to send some javelin people at you. Uh-huh. Or knife throwers.

Speaker 2
Ah, Walter would be so sad.

Speaker 1
Oh my god, that was the primary weapon that's the star knife, wasn't it?

Speaker 3
Well, the fuck the... Okay, so the flak arrows, the flak arrows has... That sucks. The flak arrows actually says ranged weapon where the other one says thrown weapon. I don't know why they would, but they still call it arrows, which is bullshit. But hey, it actually works for bullets, which is hilarious. You know what? Roll a reflex. Unusually massive weapons such as boulders or ballista bolts.

Speaker 1
Roll a reflex. We're going to do some real cool. Uh, 26. Okay. You can use that arrow immediately. Okay. Whether it's stabbing or throwing. Your choice. I will stab it. Okay. Just stab it into the hand double. -Rule cool, we're going with some rule cool here. -Hey, it ain't gonna change much. -Yeah. It's gonna hit this... -What's an arrow damage? -D8. -1D8, plus your strength modifier.

Speaker 3
-7. - Plus your... is that including your strength? -No, plus 12. -Or strength modifier? -Yeah.

Speaker 2
-Uh... 12. Yeah, it'll be 12. -12? -Just sticking the arrow in there. That could do a whole hell of up. It's still hilarious.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Now she's got an arrow in her. That's free damage. Because it's not even his turn. Uh-huh. And it does not clone as an action. Nope. Yeah. I was just...

Speaker 5
You're still hasty, too.

Speaker 1
Just remind me that I house-rolled that roll cool. So if I shoot anything else at you, roll reflexes. the thing in front of me turn? nope there's more stuff yeah well this one's done so it can't do anything yeah this one comes forward from the south yeah I'm gonna need another will save for ya there use my no wait she can see a big guy she can see a big guy she can see a big guy we'll need a will save from Max. He's big. Okay.

Speaker 2
31. Well. Oh, 41. Oh, yeah, 31.

Speaker 1
Well, I tried.

Speaker 2
Clerk.

Speaker 1
She's all big guy and heavy metal. She thought that's the one I'm going to dominate. That must be a fighter. Let's see. The little very, very very high-hungry or the huge guy with the metal. Let's go with that guy. Doesn't matter. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Decisions, decisions. Yeah, decisions, decisions. Five foot. I was right next to her, so... I was five feet away from her to start with. Oh. So, she could five foot step back, but it won't help.

Speaker 1
Oh. Since everyone wants to try this... What's your CMD? Um, 39.

Speaker 5
What? Wait. What do you rope me into now?

Speaker 2
She's gonna grapple me and take me to hell.

Speaker 5
I'm not doing that.

Speaker 1
No. Well, it never says where in hell you go. She might just lift you over a lava pit and drop you down. That would suck.

Speaker 5
Or you could be lost like your last character. This sucked after creating character just for the last games.

Speaker 1
What was your CMD? 39. Alright, she moves 5 feet. And what's your CMD 39? Yep. She moves another 5 feet.

Speaker 2
Is she tumbling or something? Yep. Okay. She's done an action and two tumbles.

Speaker 1
moving so yeah okay so she's done um nope she moves a little bit more next to the crystal there and places her hand on it uh the crystal no longer glows in this radiant right uh orange light it's now a darkened purple light oh it's probably a bad thing yep i mean maybe i'm sure it's not I'm definitely sure it's totally not gonna well depends how quickly this fight goes. It might not matter.

Speaker 2
Max. Okay, so she's moved too far for me to actually get full attack ever. Because she moved 15-20 feet after doing an action. How could she do that? If she did an action and then moved again after.

Speaker 1
You tumble as part of the move.

Speaker 2
Yeah, but she moved over to me. Oh, she stood next to me.

Speaker 1
You said that she...

Speaker 2
So she started next to me and did her action. Yeah, I thought she was 10 feet away.

Speaker 1
That's why I had her 5 feet.

Speaker 2
Okay, so she did her action and she moved over here far enough to just not be able to tumble out of my reach. Close enough to touch the crystal. She has plenty of good CMB apparently. She has good acrobatics. She has good acrobatics. Okay, great.

Speaker 1
And it looks like me.

Speaker 2
Ah, yeah. I wish I could actually, you know, full attack have her again.

Speaker 1
I know. I mean, you do like what? 10d6, 12d6 on a not full attack? But that's only if I can... Yeah, I do that, but that's still not that good comparison. 12d6 is nothing to scoff at.

Speaker 2
I know, no.

Speaker 1
It's just not nearly enough. It's more than a max fireball. That's why I don't do fireballs. That's why. Aren't you a cleric? You don't have fireball. You say that. You don't have the fire domain.

Speaker 2
That's partially why I don't have the fire domain. because fireballs suck they're actually really good when you make them dazing fireballs reflex save or you're not doing anything for three rounds or you're dazed sweet

Speaker 1
anyways uh yeah your turn yeah you move up um you don't vote because you didn't move through - I always swear.

Speaker 2
- Okay, I hit. I hit on a four, I hit on a 14.

Speaker 1
- Um, who's on deck? - Yeah.

Speaker 5
- Not good.

Speaker 1
- I got that damn song stuck in my head.

Speaker 5
- Which one? - Fireball. - You are.

Speaker 3
- Mr. Boardwide. - Okay.

Speaker 5
- Yeah, well, somebody has a Muppet song going through my head for a whole week.

Speaker 3
Thanks. Unless you actually want me to roll this, when you actually roll out the damage, I critted four times. - Oh no, she did. - Three. Technically, I rolled three 20s and two 19s. - Yeah, no, she's super good. - But one of them, the last 19 was on my lowest one, and I don't think I hit with a 26. - But I mean, you hit.

Speaker 1
I critted but I didn't... Yeah, but you didn't crit. Right.

Speaker 2
Alright. Okay, 84. 84...

Speaker 1
And there's no fortitude save with this one?

Speaker 2
No, no, I only have one casting of that because it's Clark.

Speaker 1
84... I gotta remember that I have a paper towel right here so I'll just stop marking my fingers with ink. *laughs* Um, ba ba ba ba! The pulsing crystal starts blasting off a wave of energy. Everyone make a fortitude save.

Speaker 5
Fortitude! *crash* *crash*

Speaker 1
22. I wasted all my good fucking rolls.

Speaker 3
17. 17, 22, 10. 10. 16. 16. Oh. Oh. I paid a 15.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I rolled a 1. I rolled a 2. 3, but I got a nice 2 for the last.

Speaker 2
So it's like... So you rolled the best as a 7. I have a plus 10. Yeah, I mean, I have pushed 20, but that's why I got 22 with a 2. I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1. Fuck.

Speaker 1
So we have two 1s, a 2 and a 7. Me and my boys are gonna fuck you up. I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1. Fuck. My boys are otherwise preoccupied. I rolled a take 26 unholy damage. Oh.

Speaker 4
Calm down.

Speaker 3
26. This sucks. Ow. On the upside. Just damage. On the upside. Unchain gets... Unchain gets warrior hitplanes. It's a good thing. That is a very good thing. That's the only reason I'm still alive for most of the shit.

Speaker 1
Um, not only on.

Speaker 5
Okay. Hold on, two seconds.

Speaker 1
I do that song. The... Yeah, that sucks. Pulse wave only hit these two chambers. And all the children start screaming in pain. They're not dead? I'm impressed.

Speaker 5
Alright.

Speaker 1
It's on hold of damage. No. 42 hits? Oh, no. They're petitioners. They can't die. They're stuck here. They take that damage forever. They don't die.

Speaker 5
I should have died 10 times. Is this 42 hitter?

Speaker 1
42? Yeah.

Speaker 5
44? 34? 34? I feel like yes.

Speaker 1
26? No.

Speaker 5
45.

Speaker 1
Yes. So that one dies. Well, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me try. What's your minimum damage from however many hits, 5 hits?

Speaker 5
The minimum, okay, the minimum, the maximum one hit was 44 points.

Speaker 3
Well, minimum it'd be just your extra damage without rolling.

Speaker 5
So without doing all the extras?

Speaker 1
If you rolled one on everything, what's your damage?

Speaker 5
If I rolled one on everything?

Speaker 1
Just...

Speaker 5
Five?

Speaker 2
Plus, what's your static damage bonus?

Speaker 5
I'm confused.

Speaker 2
So what are you adding to your roll?

Speaker 5
Well, I've got the 1d8, and then I've got the 2d6 for the evil... And then I've got the electric.

Speaker 3
And then your dex or your dex or strength or your...

Speaker 2
Your strength plus your deadly aim.

Speaker 3
Right.

Speaker 1
I don't think you have strength for a bow.

Speaker 5
I have add 14 damage for some Kabazza bow. Right. So that might be the add 14.

Speaker 2
Yeah, that's what you're looking for. 14 times 5 plus 20. Yeah, well, so yeah, basically 20 times 5, so 100. Okay. Yeah, it does.

Speaker 5
All right. I'm just curious how much it really would have done.

Speaker 1
Go for it. Go for it. It's Luther. Oh, it does. Yep.

Speaker 3
Um, so because, if I'm not mistaken, I have the move, move, attack and move. So I am going to Can I do that? Or is that dramatic?

Speaker 2
Well you can dance if you want to.

Speaker 5
I'm going to do 82 points of damage.

Speaker 1
You can leave this plane behind. Wait. Don't leave us here! Don't leave us here! Because the maiden don't dance and if she don't dance, she's no friend of mine. Well, do you have to start with the flying kick?

Speaker 2
No. So you could end your flying kick here. No, no, no, no, no. Uh...

Speaker 4
Move. Attack.

Speaker 5
I'm looking for the... What did you do? Why are you on the floor?

Speaker 4
I fell down. I died. I'm dying.

Speaker 5
Dying. Dying?

Speaker 4
Yeah, that last unholy burst took me all the way in the air. Oh, Jesus Christ. I fainted.

Speaker 5
I don't think I bought a shit ton of rods.

Speaker 3
Alright, I'm not gonna do it now just because I don't know. Okay. I can't find the frickin' thing to do it. Um... It's not mobility. It's like mobility... Spring attack.

Speaker 1
Combat reference, spring attack. I got that. You talking about spring attack? No, there was one that allowed you to move.

Speaker 4
Move, attack and move.

Speaker 2
Attack and move. Yeah, spring attack. I don't think that's going to let you do what you're trying to do here. Um, because you have to do a full attack. If you're doing a full attack, you can't spring attack. Okay.

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 2
Otherwise, I'd be a lot more effective.

Speaker 1
That's true.

Speaker 2
Because, yeah, good news, I hit three times weapon dice, which is awesome. However, that's what this character is built for. It doesn't mean I'm doing my static damage on each of the hits, which is why it's so much worse. Because I get plus 36.

Speaker 3
I just need to know what it actually says.

Speaker 2
Because I would have absolutely murdered the thing had I been able to do full attack.

Speaker 3
Okay, plus I have to move. I had to move 10 feet beforehand, so that didn't happen anyway.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
So is that where you're entering your turn? Uh, yep. Okay. Uh, Yizma. Down. Down. Uh, who's left? Oh, I'll go this. Uh... Arrows for everyone. Arrows for everyone!

Speaker 5
I can't wait in the back still.

Speaker 2
They probably don't have a very good shot on you. We'll just go with that.

Speaker 1
No. Arrows for Max. We'll start with those. What's your AC? 47. Are they even going to be able to do anything? arrows for everyone arrows for no one arrows for some small American flag for others

Speaker 2
yeah I have plus 13 versus spell resistance versus outsiders oh it's not spell resistance

Speaker 1
no no no no we were talking about that before okay six arrows fly at you and miss horribly okay three arrows fly at Luther what's your receipt Luther? -A praise. Hold on. -32. -32. -All right. Three arrows fly past you, except for maybe one. One doesn't.

Speaker 3
-I'm just, if they're not going to come with me, I'm not jumping forward. -Oh, okay. I mean, they're within the test. -The last one, like, just be... Actually, just for style, I will just break one as they're... You catch it and snap it? Or no, just like backhand it away. It does stumble. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Just to show how outmatched these things are against you. Exactly.

Speaker 4
I lose that other point. I've hit points on my turn, by the way. My death saving throw.

Speaker 1
You're not bleeding. What? Oh, unholy damage doesn't do that kind of damage.

Speaker 2
Oh, if you're under 0 though

Speaker 1
Yeah, negative 5 If you take physical damage If physical damage brings you down

Speaker 2
I just thought it was pretty much anything

Speaker 1
I thought it was physical damage

Speaker 2
Because fireballs will do You'll still bleed out from a fireball

Speaker 1
That doesn't make any sense I know, I'm aware I mean, unless you're still on fire You'll bleed out from a punch Yeah, but that You'll always bleed out from a punch Actually, you'll bleed them even if you don't bleed internally.

Speaker 3
Yes. I always love the kung fu movies where they get punched and they spit blood. That's what I always imagined. They spit blood.

Speaker 1
Luther, I'm going to need a will save.

Speaker 3
This ain't going to go well.

Speaker 1
We've tried almost everyone. Let's see if it works on you. 24. 24? This is going to end real quick because it's Max's turn. Okay The crystal is still purple

Speaker 2
Okay

Speaker 1
Do you do anything on the way there? I You teleported Oh you teleported Yeah I can't fit through the hole

Speaker 2
They put those little tiny doors there So yeah I'm just going to go there And I guess I'm attacking the caster

Speaker 1
The Handmaid Devil? Or the Anaris? I suppose the Handmaid Devil?

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
It's casting arrows.

Speaker 2
Are you taking Ursula or the Angels? Ursula. Okay. I hit 14 on the die again, so plus 31. So... 20, 30... 40... 52... plus 36... 50... So 88 damage. 88? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1
High! She doesn't like you as much as she used to.

Speaker 2
She didn't like me much before, but...

Speaker 1
Yeah, well now she doesn't like you at all. 20... 25...

Speaker 2
30... 35... 45... 45 is... It's 9. I'm just tracking how much of my dimensional hot movement. Oh, no.

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, go ahead. The, uh, sorry.

Speaker 2
It's actually 90 damage, but point still holds.

Speaker 1
90? Yeah. As opposed to what, 80? 8. 8 to 8?

Speaker 2
Because it's Bane, I get the plus 2 extra damage. Okay.

Speaker 1
Two damage. Okay. Um, the crystal in the middle is fading from purple to orange. Probably a good thing.

Speaker 2
Changing back.

Speaker 1
It's, yeah, it's no longer in contact with the devil. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what the trigger is. You're the one who's not touching it. You can touch it if you want, Theona. It's your turn.

Speaker 5
I ain't touching shit.

Speaker 1
You can touch the crystal.

Speaker 5
I am trying to get close enough to Ysman to actually do some healing though. The crystal is cracked. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.

Speaker 1
She's hasty.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Okay. Double move.

Speaker 1
Oh, 12, 60. Yeah.

Speaker 5
How many times is it?

Speaker 2
60 feet.

Speaker 5
I'm going to take the time. More than 60.

Speaker 1
60 plus.

Speaker 5
Fantastic Celestial healing on you.

Speaker 2
You double move. I can't yet? You could if you use your rod for the last use.

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. If you have that swift rod.

Speaker 2
Let's do that. Okay. You're not bleeding out anymore. You wasn't before. No. You're healing now. So I go to zero or do I take some? You got a hit point back. One hit point? If it's just celestial healing, yes. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 5
It's celestial healing. I don't know what it is. Target radius or a good creature for the duration spell.

Speaker 1
Oh, now your mark is good. in hell. Of course you were good

Speaker 2
in hell anyway. Actually, that might not work. There's limitations on infernal healing. You can't heal good aligned damage.

Speaker 5
That's first Celestial damage. That's healing for her to her.

Speaker 2
You're using Celestial Healing Greater? What do you have prepared?

Speaker 5
Hold on. Two seconds.

Speaker 2
No worries.

Speaker 5
One section. Where is it?

Speaker 2
Oh, you can't.

Speaker 5
Celestial Healing Grater is what I had.

Speaker 2
Okay, you can't cast that with your swift rod because it's a level four spell.

Speaker 5
Okay. Then.

Speaker 2
If you don't have it prepared, you're.

Speaker 5
I know. I'm looking. I got a bunch of stuff.

Speaker 2
You got a lot prepared.

Speaker 5
Yeah. Awesome. I'm not stupid.

Speaker 2
That's going to be a third level or lower for the rod. Yeah. Assuming she has the lesser rod. I don't remember what you want.

Speaker 1
I think she got the lesser.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Although theoretically she could just grab his rod. Her rod. I'm not rifling through a body. Well it's not her belt.

Speaker 1
I'm not rifling through a body that I know the person.

Speaker 5
We have rules. We don't rifle through purses. It's just how we do this.

Speaker 1
Since when has this been a policy for me?

Speaker 5
No touchy touchy. If it's dead that's different.

Speaker 1
It's mostly dead. It's mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. All dead. There's only one thing you can do.

Speaker 5
Am I close enough to touch then? Then I'm going to hit her with the...

Speaker 1
You don't have an action to do unless you can use that rod.

Speaker 5
Then I'll wait.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 5
I'll hold it out.

Speaker 1
Next turn. Holding out for a hero.

Speaker 5
Meantime, I'm just not trying to be within the doorway. So it's just... Yeah. You can't hit me.

Speaker 2
No, I figured I'm much more obstructive when I'm here than I'm...

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 2
Because I have heel, but... Ending the fight also helps a lot. Luther. 5, 15, 20, 25. I'm going to the other side of two.

Speaker 1
Ah, flanking. Oh, no, she has a bow out. Does she have a claw attack? Yeah, that's more than enough to do what I want to do. No. And she doesn't have a melee weapon out, so no attacks of opportunity. Not that with your movement you'd provoke one anyway. If you didn't want to.

Speaker 2
Also his acrobatics is really really good.

Speaker 3
Okay because now that I know I can do this, I'm going to shoot for a stunning fist on my first attack, for a second attack.

Speaker 4
Are you full attacking this thing? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2
Um, what is your... Well, it's much more to hit, but you know, once you hit... Yeah. It's a summon, it's probably not super... Actually...

Speaker 1
You super kill this thing. I was gonna say, what's the armor class in that? Yeah, the target number is much lower than the handmaid level, and its HP is much, much lower. So, it's dead. Super dead.

Speaker 3
Plus rocking the... Plus rocking the...

Speaker 2
Do you want to end here?

Speaker 3
Holy shit, no. I... I did this well. Maybe we'll have to continue. This order will have to do. Because now... Because now you're going to attack multiple targets. I can attack multiple targets. That's right. Because they're stupid dance. And now the dance actually makes freaking awesome. I can stun if I want to.

Speaker 1
I can stun you too. I can stun you as well. Because if your friend's not stunned, then I'm going to stun him, and then you're going to die.

Speaker 3
Okay, so...

Speaker 1
Because that's how I fight in hell. Oh, God.

Speaker 3
Three. So, I'm doing... One, two, three, four, five, six. I have seven attacks. So, first one's getting three, and then three. Two is getting three, and then three is getting three.

Speaker 2
Well, do you want to blind this person with a Stunfish on the way?

Speaker 3
They're... I mean, why not? I only get one stunning fist per attack. Where does it say that? Per round.

Speaker 2
Where does it say that?

Speaker 3
You can only do it once per round. I'm positive it said...

Speaker 1
Oh yeah, no more than once around. You read it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No more than once around. Otherwise, that would be really fun. You're pretty much flanking on every one of these attacks, except for the first one on third. Because I get... Because he's large and takes up more space, So he's flanked. So third hit?

Speaker 2
When you hit this one, you can hit this one. Here you're flanking. Alright.

Speaker 1
All behind them you're flanking. So maybe the first hit on third you're not flanking. Or number three.

Speaker 3
Alright, due to the fact that I didn't realize there were that many there, I'm gonna hit number two. Boom! Crit. confirmed? As long as 39 converts. Yeah. What's your minimum amount of crit? 3d10 plus... Okay. Go ahead and roll it.

Speaker 1
I thought about that after a second.

Speaker 2
My crits, which you've never seen, are really dangerous. Isn't it times three? Yes. With a four-die-six weapon. Five-seven. Yeah. Just be glad I can't have it be a weapon that counts as one size larger. Because that all would... Aren't you already larger? No, no, no, no. That's my point.

Speaker 1
Four-die-six is with the larger.

Speaker 2
Yes. Okay. But if it was a... If the weapon was a, let me just add this for just the entertainment value.

Speaker 1
And none of this damage provokes attacks of opportunity. Correct. Okay. That's over here, Dan.

Speaker 5
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 3
So he's taking 78 points of damage? 78.

Speaker 5
There's a thing called fast swallow?

Speaker 3
Yep. Wait. More. Wait more. I did this on purpose so that he'd have to take my dance jams. 78. 28. 88. 93. 93 points.

Speaker 1
93 points. Okay. Number two. I'm going to do this. Who is not looking so healthy?

Speaker 3
Number three does... 39? Yep. Okay, they both hit. Oh, these are all evil, correct? Yep. All right.

Speaker 1
Although they look like angels. Yeah, we know better. With black feather wings. No, he might actually mistake them as angels, because... We fought these before. And I think he mistake them as angels that time, too. They were evil that time. They were evil every time. Details. Yeah, um... To Luthor, everything is either a demon or an angel. And these ones definitely look more angel.

Speaker 2
So yeah, it goes from 12 die 6 to 18 die 6 if I had the size bonus on it. Good grief. Uh-huh. And then, or I just attack, you know, four times at...

Speaker 1
You're not doing any elemental damage, right? I am not. Okay, give me the total for all your hit.

Speaker 2
Because yeah, that's impact. Plus one size for damage, plus an enhances for Bulrush, which, you know, is something I do a lot of. It'd be hilarious if I could do it for free, but not worth doing.

Speaker 3
He gets... number three gets 74. 74.

Speaker 1
74. four.

Speaker 3
So that's one, two, three, four. I mean, that would be hilarious, but I think- Alright, this one, is this the uh- The one in the middle is the handmaiden. Okay, the handmaiden. So, stunning fist, I'm going to declare stunning fist on that handmaiden. Hit and hit. Fortitude save. Fortitude save plus... 23.

Speaker 1
She made it.

Speaker 2
Okay. Oh well. Oh down to 15.

Speaker 1
Down to 15, that can be used a lot more liberally than we had thought originally. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2
Just think these all could be shocking hits too, if you wanted.

Speaker 3
Once per attack. Okay. So I get one extra d6 somewhere, but I'm not worried about it.

Speaker 2
Monks are weird. Okay.

Speaker 3
And she'll take 70. 70. Wait, no, hold on. Uh, 74.

Speaker 2
Which means she's been hit a couple times now.

Speaker 3
Well, I have holy damages per punch, and I only added it once.

Speaker 2
Makes sense. No, she's only been hit. I hit her once. For 90.

Speaker 1
Oh, that's what that number was. Yeah. Sorry, 70... What, you said? 74. That's why I had that number right now.

Speaker 2
Yeah, because she got asked the question. 74. Mind if I asked you a question? That would be my level of diplomacy here. Minus two.

Speaker 1
Excuse me. Do you mind if I ax you the statement? Damn it. Ask me questions, I'll tell you my lies. Oh, I don't tell lies. I ax questions. Take your attack of opportunity on number two. Okay, sure. Going all in, all in nothing. Nope, I missed. You missed?

Speaker 2
Yeah, I rolled out one.

Speaker 1
All right.

Speaker 2
I don't miss on the confirmation, but you know, details. I'm going to need you two to roll me a will save. Who? You two. All right. 30. Okay.

Speaker 3
We're fucked.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
You're... 9. 9? Ooh. Okay.

Speaker 1
I'm taking automatically negative 2 for a will save. You guys are both lawful neutral?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
calculations oh they're doing a blight or something or oh yeah it doesn't work that well on us oh but work great on me oh i really thought you're dead you're super dead you're within range of it

Speaker 1
oh no it's 20 foot first oh good you're not dead then yeah she's focused on the on the middle Oh, I thought... Oh, I'm good then. I thought I was getting dominated.

Speaker 2
Oh, yeah, it's not as high a level.

Speaker 1
Oh, no, this is the angel casting, that thing.

Speaker 2
Oh. Oh, okay. I don't know what that means, but okay. Yeah, I thought this was the handmaid devil doing a more powerful thing. Oh. I don't know. Only good to... I'm good with damage. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Give me damage. I'm up all day. It doesn't do much, really. Not against non-good creatures, yeah. Maximum 5 to 8 damage. Not against non-good creatures. 23, half of that is... Oh, no, no, no, I was wrong. And half of that. So you take 11 points of damage and you take half of that.

Speaker 2
Well, it's 5 to 8. Yeah. Half damage of that.

Speaker 1
No, that is the half damage. You take half of 11 and you take 11.

Speaker 2
Okay, so you rolled like 22 or whatever? Yeah, 23. Sure. So I take 4?

Speaker 1
5? 11, 5. Okay, yeah. Tickles. Luther, do you have combat reflexes? Yes. No, not you. Not even close. Okay, Luther, take your attack of opportunity against number 3.

Speaker 5
Not you, the other Luther.

Speaker 3
Does a 32 hit.

Speaker 1
Can you send me a attack opportunity? Well, you're damaged against number three. I don't think she has the...

Speaker 2
I'm just picturing that. She walks away and you hear the eyes on the way out.

Speaker 3
Stuck her in the back of the head.

Speaker 2
Hit her so hard. She's blind for the right life.

Speaker 1
There's nowhere that the man made any kind of splits. Can I use Stunning Fist on an attack of opportunity? It's a different action. I don't think you can. Alright.

Speaker 4
Once per round. We'll say no.

Speaker 2
Not this time. Once per round though. So, okay. That would just be hilarious.

Speaker 1
It seems too powerful to be able to do this. I agree. Especially if you have combat reflexes once per round, so I guess.

Speaker 2
Well, combat reflexes isn't.

Speaker 1
No, but like you couldn't.

Speaker 2
Once per round. Still hilarious. Hey. Oh. I'm going to run away.

Speaker 1
No, you're not. 24. 24? All right. She starts casting a spell and Luthor says, nah, and punches her in the throat and kills her.

Speaker 5
Jesus.

Speaker 1
That's what happens when Luthor punches people in the throat. When they have 20 HP. I literally have throat punch. Luthor, you said you had combat reflexes? I do. Alright, roll an attack roll against number 1. Yeah, I didn't bother with combat reflexes because my dex mod is 1. Uh, 30... Yep, 4. Okay, roll your damage. You've got a little concentration check. Oh, not happening. Of not slightly.

Speaker 2
Was it 10 plus damage dealt? Yeah.

Speaker 1
12. That's just her caster level. Yeah. Not likely is the answer. Uh, 31. Oh yeah, she can't do that. Uh, 31 damage? 31 damage. Okay. 31 damage and she lost her spell. 31 damage to you in hell. Oh, plus the spell level. yeah that didn't matter yeah that's pretty much how it goes yeah but they got the command all or nothing and the handmaiden devil can't five foot anywhere to be not within reach five foot away from me I can't I mean there's no five foot that she can move to that you aren't already threatening unless I moved to that one and you just follow her exactly I mean it's an all or nothing moment so she's gonna try it she's gonna grapple you and take you to hell yes didn't say which part of hell you go back up to the first letter of hell the eternal battlefield we say this like this is a bad thing where demons and devils always fight oh um Concentration. And is 15 plus double spell level? Yep. Um, meeny meeny myeny Luthor. Luthor. Yep. Will save. I will fail. Oh? Uh, 24. You will not. Yay! What did she cast?

Speaker 2
She, uh, spellcraft. Take 5 is 24.

Speaker 1
Dominate person. Ah. That would be bad. Like I said, it's an all or nothing moment for these guys right now. Now it's going to be Max's turn. Okay, good. Now I can full attack. Yep. And what's linking? She dies. And the Aenerys... What's her middle one damage for, let's say, two hits? How many Texas do you get for round? Four.

Speaker 2
Four? Let's say three hits. Each hit does four die six plus 36. Or six die six plus 36. So minimum damage.

Speaker 1
42. You kill both of them. Oh, wait, there's... Three. I assume you're attacking the handmaiden and number one. Who is the least hurt.

Speaker 2
I mean, I can just start rolling, because that makes it easy. I could critical once.

Speaker 1
Yeah, she's only going to take one hit no matter what.

Speaker 2
Okay, dead.

Speaker 1
The Handmaiden Devil takes one hit.

Speaker 2
Okay, number one is 38 to hit. Yeah. And does... 10... Oh, it's 1... 20... 21... 57 damage to the first hit. Okay, she takes two hits. Okay. And your final hit, if you hit, you kill it. Okay, final hit, yeah, maybe not. That's, um, 17 plus 9 is 28.

Speaker 1
Yeah, that hits.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
All right. They're all dead.

Speaker 2
Okay, cool.

Speaker 1
I can full attack once. Weird. But number two had one HP, by the way. Wait, bleed it, though. Blood.

Speaker 3
I always forget about blood.

Speaker 1
She bled on her turn and well she didn't even cast Blast Me anyway so. At 1d4. That was enough to kill her. Jesus. 1d4. 1d4 is bleed. What a tie.

Speaker 2
So on her turn she cast

Speaker 1
the spell. She might have only been staggered if they only did one point of damage. You want to roll we can roll that just for the

Speaker 2
she staggered. So she did get the spell off. Thank you.

Speaker 1
Thank you. What's this? Cinnamon cookie. It's your plate.

Speaker 5
He's like, "What do I need a plate for? I'm just gonna eat the whole thing in one bite."

Speaker 3
I'll reach in and heal you. Thank you.

Speaker 2
I used to heal real, so 170. 170? Heal. Be well, sir. Ah-eh-eh-ee-oh-oh.

Speaker 4
Alright then.

Speaker 2
And then I will use the Pearl of Power to regain that heal spell because I feel like I might need it later.

Speaker 4
Yeah, especially if I'm walking through combat.

Speaker 2
Next time you use spells on the enemies, just saying, as a sorcerer that's what we expect. I tried, yeah.

Speaker 4
When? On that one.

Speaker 2
What'd you do to her?

Speaker 4
The spell of diplomacy.

Speaker 2
Oh. Oh. I was expecting spells to cast.

Speaker 4
Oh. I figured you guys got this, so I was going to go handle whatever was in there. Yeah, that's it.

Speaker 1
In there, there was actually... There's two handmaid of devils in there, one in each of these chambers, and the one that was in the south there was summoning. So, if you had gone in there, you would have met at least four devils.

Speaker 4
invisibly. I would have gone invisibly. You would have walked in and been like, nope, invisible. Listen, I had plans. I just went down 40, 45 hit points before I had a chance to start executing the plans.

Speaker 2
Well, had you disintegrated, you wouldn't have gone down hit points. It was the crystal that... Well, no. Had you disintegrated her, she wouldn't have gotten any attacks opportunity on him. She hit him.

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, she did crit, yeah.

Speaker 4
That's true, yes.

Speaker 1
But also the only damage from this thing.

Speaker 2
She wouldn't have been able to do any of that had you killed her.

Speaker 1
You're right. You are right. I was going to say, because I tried to dominate him.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 4
I was planning on dominating in return. I was like, oh.

Speaker 1
But then you just walked past it and got hit four times.

Speaker 4
That's because you already deal it. I hit it once. I was like, I'll go deal with something else.

Speaker 2
Anyways. Anyways. So which gate do we want to go through? Them children's. They're children's. Poor children's. Do we have any way of rescuing them?

Speaker 1
I don't know. I don't.

Speaker 2
They are not evil.

Speaker 1
Bless them all.

Speaker 3
I mean, because I... Is there any way to destroy the... Heart? The heart.

Speaker 1
The giant crystal? The giant crystal. I mean, eventually, sure.

Speaker 2
I... We can't spend too much time. I have spells that are taking down guys.

Speaker 3
Kamehameha... I'm going to hit it with a quivering palm. I'll kill it in like 10 days.

Speaker 1
For 10 days. You realize that affects living creatures, not objects.

Speaker 2
Well, I mean, the way he describes it, setting up destructive vibrations should work out. You make its heart explode.

Speaker 1
Okay, maybe you have some argument here.

Speaker 3
and he has the ability to ignore the hardness of the thing um that's the only thing i that's not in it if it could be if it could be destroyed in a couple hits well i mean just the hit of

Speaker 2
the hardness is an enormous crystal no i'm just picturing ignore the hardness set up a destructive vibration that makes it blow up 10 days later

Speaker 1
monks are weird i'm sorry it's so fucking weird do you want to use your a quivering palm for that ability? I do not. I really don't want to touch it. What? No? You don't? I really don't. You saw what happens when the demon or devil touches it? Yep. I'm not good.

Speaker 3
It might hurt other people.

Speaker 2
I think you should touch it. You're not feeling it. You would say that. So the question is When we kill these things here, they stay dead, right? Uh, the bodies are there, yeah I just figured, you know, it's weird Because most of the time when we kill enemies They don't stay dead

Speaker 1
Nerosens return to their native plane

Speaker 2
Uh-huh, but when we kill them here, they dead

Speaker 1
No, but They stay They're not dead?

Speaker 4
I thought that

Speaker 1
Nerosens still returns to hell

Speaker 2
Well, can we look the Irines now? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah Weirdly enough

Speaker 1
Holy crap, we can loot demons. You can loot devils.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
They do fade away long enough for you to loot them in your world, too.

Speaker 2
Oh, I thought you couldn't loot the...

Speaker 1
Normally summon things, you can't loot them. Well, summon things, yeah. Summon things. But they fade away long enough that you could take their equipment or something. Or coins or whatever. But, like, you couldn't keep their head. Oh, yeah, yeah, no. What do you have? Well thanks. Thank you for telling me that they have standard treasure. Okay. Let's try it. I actually have equipment.

Speaker 2
Why don't we just do a treasure generator? Because there is a thing. That way you don't have to roll on the tables.

Speaker 1
No, there's, I mean it's, there's actually, it's already, yeah, it's just not on them. Okay. It's just like finding a dragon horde. Yep. Later. Standard, standard, standard. But these things, these aniris actually do have equipment, unlike the handmaiden devils. Yep, yep that. Their equipment includes... Feathers. Plus one longsword, so times three. Yep. Plus one flaming composite longbow with a five strength.

Speaker 2
Who's writing the stone?

Speaker 4
I've got notes. Otherwise I can write it down if you want.

Speaker 2
And three ropes. Well The first two are valuable The flaming composite longbow is worth a lot

Speaker 1
To some

Speaker 2
Well It's worth a decent amount It's like a grand a piece Yeah So Nothing for us And plus one longsword Yeah So it's basically ten grand a guy So Ten grand Two grand for the longsword Eight grand for the longbow

Speaker 1
Okay Because it's plus Two

Speaker 2
I mean it's more than that

Speaker 1
Half of that

Speaker 2
Well I mean it's more than that But then we have it all

Speaker 1
At that point it's neglected At this level it's negligible Half of a long sword Who cares

Speaker 2
But yeah decent money Anyways

Speaker 1
Sure that's $5,000 per Resale plus the jump change That I don't care about Yeah There's a go. On all resale. Unless someone actually wants to use the plus one flaming deposit longfall. For what? I don't know. Someone have five strength? I mean, yeah, I have ten. But that's not the point. I can't use it. Why not? Why not? Oh, yeah, because you don't have the skill to.

Speaker 2
It's a martial weapon.

Speaker 1
He takes a minus four penalty on that.

Speaker 2
And then I get to add my dex mod to hit.

Speaker 1
So, negative three.

Speaker 2
No, no, to hit.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Minus three, yeah. One plus negative four. Yes. Really super not worth it. There's a south portal and a north portal. What do you guys want to do? North or south? This is north. This area seems... Yeah, north is Casey. This area seems to be a relaxation area for the handmaid. It seems to take shifts torturing children.

Speaker 2
Do they have loot there too? No. Okay. I figure if they relax here, they might store their shit here.

Speaker 1
They might.

Speaker 2
But I figured I'd ask. Anyways.

Speaker 1
They don't live here. It's just a break room. It's just a break room. This is where when their whipping arm gets tired, that's when they go to the break room. I whip children eight hours a day. I gotta go take a rest, guys.

Speaker 2
Well, I'm up for going north, guys. What do you think? We don't have anything to base it off of, right?

Speaker 3
That's fine.

Speaker 2
North it is. I'm just taking this one. I'll take it or not.

Speaker 5
You have to take them.

Speaker 3
You don't. Have to. Really? I thought that was one of the rules. Well, we don't.

Speaker 2
It's just every time we do this it makes the room weaker. Oh, right.

Speaker 1
Traveling through the northern portal there.

Speaker 2
Yep.

Speaker 1
We'll need... That map. This one. Who is here? Yeah, actually that portal where we used mine is. Is there, you said you're taking this one? No, no. Yeah. Max's. Max's? Max's taking this one early? Yep. Alright. Everyone roll a 4 tootsay? Of course. Except for Max who is taking the damage. Okay.

Speaker 5
17 again. 17.

Speaker 2
23. 23. Before we go through, do we want to do some healing, guys? For everyone who's not already healed from a spell?

Speaker 5
I don't... Do those rods... Do the rods of healing do anything for unholy damage?

Speaker 2
No, I can just use kill like wounds of you guys.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 2
Actually, you know what? I've got channel energy. Okay. What? You never do that. That's because it sucks. *laughter* Whatever. Well, I have one use a day of it. Isn't it, at this level, like... 9-6. 9-6.

Speaker 1
Yeah, 96. That's not nothing.

Speaker 2
It's not nothing. It's just once a day.

Speaker 1
23, 17. 23, I need your 14. 29.

Speaker 5
So are you healing us after we go through or before you...

Speaker 2
34. Oh, I'll do it right after. So for 31. Okay.

Speaker 1
So Yzma take... 5 points of fire, 5 points of Bunholi. Same with Luthor. Liana take 10 points of fire and 11 points of unholy. And same with Max. I am so glad I don't take the fire. Well, no one takes the fire.

Speaker 5
That's right.

Speaker 1
We're all so glad we don't take fire.

Speaker 5
So it's just regular damage? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4
Fire and unholy damage.

Speaker 1
The unholy is just a descriptor. It's a damage type, like acid.

Speaker 4
If you were more susceptible or something like that.

Speaker 1
Angels take extra damage from unholy damage. And evil outsiders take no damage from unholy damage. So were you saying you'd have what? 5 and 5, 5 and 5, 10 and 11, 10 and 11.

Speaker 2
Everyone has resisted fire 30. No, what did you do for heal?

Speaker 1
31. And then you patched everyone up with a 31, gets back 31 HP. After

Speaker 2
we walk on the portal. After? Yep. So you're perfectly fine.

Speaker 5
I'm still 85.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 5
Which is why I haven't volunteered to go through anything.

Speaker 2
Well, I mean, you can kind of say something for her. Because I have healing spells, I just need to go to use them.

Speaker 1
Ooh, Max took on this one, eh? Yes. Again, As you accept the flaw into your being, the tower shakes and rumbles as a voice from above follows out in anger and hatred. Mm-hmm. Minus two to what? I don't know. I don't know, and neither do you. Okay. Um. I'll take myself a little one. As you take on the contempt flaw. Okay. Everyone sees the vision of Grisali as a bored-looking young man forcing a crime servant to clean a filthy chamber pot without any tools. Take a minus two to your AC.

Speaker 2
Oh, okay.

Speaker 1
Which I guess is actually really good, considering you're in the high 40s or mid-40s all the time. Well, for now. So, this room... Yeah.

Speaker 2
You just use your wand of two light ones. D8 plus one each time. Cool.

Speaker 1
Eww. Eww. Eww. Eww. Disgusting. Vines as thick as human arms grow along the walls. They form completely identical patterns at right angles on each wall. A large circular plant box in the middle of the room hosts a tangle of larger plants whose roots drawing sustenance from a bed of the damned that cry out in pain as their bodies serve as fertilizer. To one side of this horrific display sits a room with two stone benches to the western air. While the opposite end of the room has all but eroded away from a constant dripping of thick, polluted water. Okay.

Speaker 5
Disgusting. It's the eternal quag of stench.

Speaker 2
Oh, I should have mentioned that, but that's my...

Speaker 3
I'm going to walk into the room with the two benches.

Speaker 1
Look that way?

Speaker 3
Yep. Okay. Yeah, same.

Speaker 1
We don't... Luther. and Max are moving.

Speaker 2
What do we see?

Speaker 1
I need a Fortitude Save from Max.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
Yes. Yes. 38. Alright. One of the plants inside there puffs out a bunch of spores as you move. And they kind of drift slowly down and you're just like huh, spores. Luther, you have no reaction to this whatsoever. You are mean to poisons, right?

Speaker 2
Also, probably not even breathing. And I can...

Speaker 4
He's been holding his breath since last Tuesday.

Speaker 2
Right, he said so.

Speaker 3
Look at that. I actually said I was holding my breath.

Speaker 1
The whole time he said, Al.

Speaker 3
As long as it's not... I don't have mild nature. As long as it's not 15 hours. We're longer here for longer than 15 hours. Then I might have to take a breath. No. Knowledge nature.

Speaker 5
I have knowledge. Plants.

Speaker 3
Yeah. 18. 11. 11? 18?

Speaker 2
That shit ain't natural, guys. It's not natural.

Speaker 1
Actually, no. It is natural. It's a plant. I didn't say I was correct. Oh, sorry. I thought you were poor Luther's knowledge. You said 11? This is Max. There are a number of known plants that have poisonous powders, or poisonous spores, usually triggered by a proximity alert. Apparently, movement. Luther. You got an 18 on your knowledge nature? Yes. You narrow that down to... The actual vines in the pots, in the plant pot there, are the ones that are bursting. So not all of the vegetation in there is reacting to your emotions. And you're not actually on the stairs, right? Because you're going through that portal. You don't come up the stairs to be where you are. Well, I'm just big enough that I don't fit. Yeah, yeah. I'm just checking that you're not actually on the stairs.

Speaker 2
Well, I'm only on the stairs just because I'm walking this way. So I'm effectively walking up on the stairs.

Speaker 1
So like one leg on the stairs, one leg on the flat ground. Captain Morgan. Yeah, Captain Morgan. Yeah. Okay. That's kind of where I imagined you were.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
So I see there's a portal on the other side of the room, too. There's a portal. Yes, there's two portals, one beyond.

Speaker 2
Let's go through this one if we don't see any enemies here. Yeah, do we see any enemies? I mean, aside from plants. I guess plants are evil, but... Um, make a sense motive. Oh, wrong guy. I mean, I know for a fact the plants aren't technically evil. Or they are technically evil.

Speaker 1
You'll have to tell me. 28? That plant that tried to burst you with spores definitely wants to eat your guys' face. Oh, gotcha.

Speaker 3
Okay.

Speaker 1
Like, it is currently actively trying to eat your paces.

Speaker 2
Okay, so I'll try to hit it.

Speaker 1
Oh, you're going up to it?

Speaker 2
Well, I'm not moving that much closer.

Speaker 1
Well, yeah. I have reach. You'd have to move up to the pit to get to it. Okay. Initiative? Yep, I guess we're rolling initiative. Shocks in it. Hey, I did it this time. Oh, me?

Speaker 3
Okay. I was going to be like, it's a plant.

Speaker 1
It is a plant. We could leave. You could leave.

Speaker 4
That's what I figured.

Speaker 1
I mean you still have that option. You're gonna outpace the plant I bet.

Speaker 3
I always, whenever we play plants and shit like that, I always remember Homer Simpson, he's like "Oh no, it's eating us!" and then he just pushes over, he's like "It's just a plant." He like tears open the pot and it was like a flower that was eating them and all of a sudden, two seconds later he just it's just a plan that's what i've always imagined like that's basically what you do be just fly traps it's just a plan it's just a plan i got the wing cutter here

Speaker 2
is it evil no it's a plan well i i ask you just because i can see if it's evil that's why I know, normally speaking, it won't be evil, but it is a hell plant. Maybe not a hell plant, but it's in hell, and it's a plant.

Speaker 1
It has been tainted by the realm.

Speaker 2
Okay, so it's an evil outsider?

Speaker 1
No. So it is a hell plant. It is a hell plant. It has been tainted. It might have some fire resistance. I would say, is it susceptible to fire? Oh, and the cold persistence. Just plant. No, because hell. It's a demon plant. It is super demon plant, actually.

Speaker 2
Okay, if it's demon plant enough, I can hit it, hurt it with extra... It's not evil, though. I don't care. Okay. Is it outsider, though? No. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1
It's a plant. Ah, oh well. I suppose it does need to be evil outsider. It is not evil, nor is it an outsider. Oh, well. I'll just hit it with X. Um, okay. Everyone had their initiatives. Yes, I heard. Yeah, I know, it's great. I don't know how this works. So roll a perception. Uh, not Luther. Uh, I rolled terrible. 32. 32? Okay. So it is the one that was trying to puss cloud at you. It's right there. Okay.

Speaker 3
Why does that post cloud look like a hellhole? It does. It's...

Speaker 4
When you're high enough, it does look like a hellhole.

Speaker 1
It is the closest large thing that I had in hand. When you're high enough, it does look like a hellhole. So I need initiatives?

Speaker 2
19. I rolled the wrong...

Speaker 1
19?

Speaker 2
I rolled the wrong dice. Here you go. For its friends. I mean, just in case. Seven. Hey, you stole my roll!

Speaker 1
Did you say 17 or 19?

Speaker 2
19. I rolled 18 on the die.

Speaker 1
14. 14.

Speaker 2
And Leanna's got hold for now?

Speaker 1
Yeah. You said seven? Seven. Yes. And Leanna's gonna hold her actions.

Speaker 3
That's what happens when you roll a 1.

Speaker 1
Max. You approach this plant.

Speaker 2
Start chopping plants. Traditional. Traditional. Does a 41 hit? Yeah. It's a plant. It is a plant. But you never know.

Speaker 3
One of them dancing plants.

Speaker 2
I miss on the third hit But I don't technically miss Does 22 hit No Okay, so I only hit twice Because the 17 I rolled a 5

Speaker 3
What to say, how do you Only roll a Same way Same way I do on my 6 On your 6th or 7th attack, on your 8th or 9th attack, because you're freaking out.

Speaker 1
Because I only had... You can dance if you want to. You can leave your face at night.

Speaker 3
Somebody did the necromancy, and now that one was stuck in my head. Okay. Because if you're not dead, you're a friend of mine. Because if you're undead.

Speaker 4
It's your chance to do...

Speaker 2
48 damage on the first hit. Okay. and

Speaker 1
you're not doing any elemental damage right?

Speaker 2
no no no just giant axe

Speaker 1
you can just give me all the damage together

Speaker 2
if I was adding up the okay so 48 48 in the first one and 46 in the second one

Speaker 1
so Yeah, that's about right.

Speaker 2
Probably wrong but it's close enough. 48 plus 46. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you have 94. Okay.

Speaker 1
Yizuma.

Speaker 4
Yo.

Speaker 1
The plant is hostile.

Speaker 4
The plant is hostile. Sounds like fire is the way to go with this. Alright. I have the breath up and I have never used. Did you cast the sweeping? It's a reflex. Wait. Breath weapon. Yeah.

Speaker 2
You do know it's resistant to fire. The plants are?

Speaker 1
Yeah. No, it doesn't. Oh. I wouldn't even know that. Because it was said, I thought? No. No one did knowledge planes on this. Yeah, I didn't acknowledge nature. Oh, we did their own nature.

Speaker 3
Okay. Yeah. Okay, whatever. It's a plant that's a poisonous vine.

Speaker 2
Oh, sure. Whatever.

Speaker 3
That's what I got to do.

Speaker 2
I thought someone said that.

Speaker 3
We were...

Speaker 4
DC 27.

Speaker 3
You were discussing a character that it may or may not have Okay, I didn't catch that. Be a product of its environment. 27.

Speaker 2
Okay, it failed. Which is fair. I mean, it doesn't affect my character much. What do I do? I hit things. I hit things. Sometimes I cast spells. Like, you know, destroy all things I touch type spells. But, you know, I didn't do it there.

Speaker 5
She wonders if I look at her stuff. The one in Cedarburg is coming up pretty quick. It's the day after Memorial Day. Or it's the day before Memorial Day. It's that Sunday. And I've got the thing on Saturday. So I'm like, I can't guarantee I can be there. It's not fair. So. What did I miss?

Speaker 1
I'm dead. Roll initiative. Roll initiative. Yes, sir. So we know where to put you in. We're shooting your holding action.

Speaker 5
29.

Speaker 2
Yeah, you're holding action.

Speaker 1
That's awesome.

Speaker 5
I roll a 20 and I have a plus 9.

Speaker 3
Actually, everybody's going, but I'm going to go before y'all.

Speaker 2
That's what you think. She's just holding her action, waiting for something to happen that she needs to interject with.

Speaker 3
There's a plant and it's poisonous. It's venomous, not poisonous.

Speaker 2
I don't know.

Speaker 3
You don't know if it's poisonous. What's that? You don't know if it's poisonous. You haven't tried to eat it. That's why I changed and said it's venomous.

Speaker 1
You don't know if it's venomous. It doesn't try to eat you. It's a bit poison. Oh. I guess technically that is venomous. I don't know. What is venomous? 73 points of damage. 73 fire damage?

Speaker 4
Fire damage, yes.

Speaker 1
It does a little less than what you think, but definitely hurt it. 73? 73. So that's burned. Do some math. 73.

Speaker 4
Burn! Kind of.

Speaker 2
Somewhat burned. A little burned. A little buck. He's hungry. A heavy-duty burn. Best creature to use it on this plane of existence. Yes. Is there any other plants that got burned for that? Oh, yeah. Come on.

Speaker 4
It's a, yeah. How big is the cone? 30 foot.

Speaker 3
30 foot. Dragon fire. So. Dragon breath. Dragon breath.

Speaker 1
Can you have it?

Speaker 2
Pretty much from here to here.

Speaker 1
All right, so all the plants got burned in there. So if there was reinforcements... Two of them react and dodge for half damage, I think?

Speaker 4
Yes, they pull up their skirts.

Speaker 1
We're talking about old cartoons. They pull up their... Two plants react... Sorry, you said 73? 73. - Three, two, half, 72, three, five, 36. - Seven, 36.

Speaker 2
- Good way to determine what's there.

Speaker 3
- So I figured. - Try any side if you can hold your breath and talk at the same time.

Speaker 2
- Mokes are weird.

Speaker 4
- Of all the great, of all the classes, I would think yes to them.

Speaker 2
I'm assuming you're doing interpretive dance and people understand you.

Speaker 4
He does fart movements with his hands.

Speaker 2
Well, I mean, with his tongue of sudden move, he can do interpretive dance and everyone can understand him.

Speaker 4
The enemy over yonder.

Speaker 3
Damn it, that's a weird point.

Speaker 5
How big is that pit? Is that circle? Both thirty-few.

Speaker 4
One, two.

Speaker 3
I'm trying to

Speaker 2
The monks need grenades. They're good for swarms early on. Um, Liana. Yep. They're entertaining.

Speaker 1
They have snow bombs. So what you saw, I don't know what you saw. Never used them. Luther and Max started heading towards those benches, and one of those vine things went, and blasted a bunch of powder into the air. And then Max was like, I'm going to hit this thing with an axe. And Yuzma's like, I'm going to light this thing on fire. Okay. Now what do you do?

Speaker 5
I'm going to acid pit it. Okay. I'm not even going to shoot it. I'm just going to acid pit it.

Speaker 1
Okay. Remind me again how this works. Reflux saves. Yeah. How big is the pit?

Speaker 5
Ten foot by ten foot by ten foot deep per two level.

Speaker 1
Okay, which one are you targeting? Are you putting it directly under them?

Speaker 2
She can get any two. Actually, she can get all four, all of them, but this one can get plus two on the safe.

Speaker 1
They'll get plus two on the safe.

Speaker 2
No, this one has a toe in it.

Speaker 5
It's a reflex safe.

Speaker 2
So if you hit here, well, either way, two of them are going to get plus two on the safe. What's the safe?

Speaker 5
Reflex.

Speaker 2
What's the DC? What's the DC?

Speaker 5
You want me to think?

Speaker 2
Yes. On the flip side, this means I should bull rush.

Speaker 5
No spell resistance.

Speaker 2
Because if they fail the bull rush, they automatically fall in.

Speaker 5
The walls of the pit are red slippery. You have a climb D.

Speaker 2
But yeah, DC, it's a level 4 spell. What's your int mod?

Speaker 5
I'm trying to flip back and forth. That's not helpful. I told you this modifier is plus 5.

Speaker 1
Okay, so 19. Use this to mark the actual pit where it is. Right there. Okay, so 19 is the DC?

Speaker 2
Or 17 for this guy. For these two.

Speaker 1
Okay. They're all still on solid ground.

Speaker 5
Okay. This is a partial barrier.

Speaker 2
Hmm. Sorry.

Speaker 5
Pull him forward. Grab him and pull him forward. Anything else? Use one of those three ropes we have. You have a move action? What?

Speaker 1
You have a move action?

Speaker 5
I'm just going to stay where I am. How intelligent are these things?

Speaker 2
Do they have an intelligence score? I don't know. That's why I have to look at the page. Don't know if they can be bulrush though, really. Don't know how well planted they are. Rooted.

Speaker 4
They are the awa of hell. They're interconnected to every other plant.

Speaker 5
This is what I'm saying, if I got their root system it would hurt them at least, I would think.

Speaker 2
Three, four, five, six.

Speaker 5
Well, trees go out as far as their roots as they are.

Speaker 2
Yeah, but you didn't actually put it, but it's an extra-nointial pit. It's not actually there, mostly.

Speaker 5
My thought was to damage the plant.

Speaker 2
I mean, it's fun. It's fun. It's the spell I use the most in Rise of the Remarge. I'm sure it's Michelle.

Speaker 1
Michelle, I'm gonna need... It's everyone but Lyanna to make a fortitude. No, not Luther. I failed.

Speaker 2
What? I failed. Oh. Yeah, I rolled a 1. Same. Wow. Okay. So, I can't succeed is what that boils down to. Because I've rolled a lot of really, really shitty rolls recently. Oh, wait. Wait, you know what? That's life. The dice giveth Yeah, definitely And the dice ticketh away Yes I mean my odds were really good I needed a 2 probably Maybe a 4 But I can't rely on that

Speaker 1
That one's a melee with you already so it's just gonna start fighting you. Would it happen to me?

Speaker 2
How long that would happen to me? You can make your friends for harm, but your friends don't dance to live, they don't dance to live, no friends of mine. Okay. I'm just going to full attack you. Well, did it, did what it do to me affect my AC or anything? Nope. Okay.

Speaker 1
And you'll actually get another will save after this point attack. Do you want all the damage at once? No, I need it all separately. You need to know how many times or do you need every damage site?

Speaker 2
I need to know how many times if Edmund will have DR10 right now, unless it's magic attacks. Um... Considering I don't think they have magic weapons. They are magic attacks. Oh, okay. So I have DR3 then. Too bad they have magic attacks.

Speaker 1
Your AC is... 45. That won't hit. That won't hit. That won't hit. That... won't hit. Okay. Problem solved. No, you did get hit once. It actually bit into you. And... Got you real good, actually. Oh. It critted me? Yep. Oh, well the good news is it did minimal damage on that bike. Okay, so it's your fur to crit though.

Speaker 2
You need my one? Yeah. Two 20s in a row. That'll do it. That's what you need to prove it. No. What?

Speaker 1
So take, do you want physical damage separate? Yeah. Okay, so take... 20 physical damage from that crit. And then 6 points of acid damage. That stuff does not get doubled on the crit. I'm okay with that. Doubling the acid damage is not... And then it slashed at you with a bunch of vines that all tinked off your armor like it wasn't even there.

Speaker 2
Okay. I mean, had it not been a magical hit, it would have done almost nothing.

Speaker 1
That's true.

Speaker 2
There's a reason why I wasn't particularly... don't care too much about having DR10 magic. It doesn't do much. That's the third one.

Speaker 1
Five, ten. Move it ten forward. This one? Yep. Okay. Towards Yuzma. Okay, it does have to make a save again. I know. It doesn't.

Speaker 2
It doesn't save?

Speaker 1
5 to 10. Yeah, it only has 5 to 10. No, it doesn't make... It doesn't know that it has to make a save. Okay. That's your... Oh, that's awesome. It doesn't. No. What was the DC on that pit? 17. 17.

Speaker 2
It can roll one like I can.

Speaker 1
Rolled low, but I don't think it rolled low enough. Where are your stupid...

Speaker 2
Plants are known for the reflux saves, generally. Yeah. But high enough, CR creatures still have decent saves.

Speaker 1
What's the DC? 17. 17? I made it. Okay. Not by much. It is possible to not make it. Mm-hmm. I think if they end their turns there, they also have to make a DC. They do. That's a save, right? Because it's a slippery slope. Yep. But both of them are much better than that one was. They can only move 10 feet because they are not fast. Being plants, I'm not actually shocked. Makes it finally Luther's turn. Don't end your... Oh, make a new will save. Oh, sure. After that thing goes up. Yes. 26. Okay. You come to something that might have been trying to affect your mind.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
I was supposed to be enticed by this thing. I'm not going inside that pit. Maybe your only actions were going to be head towards that Earth Elemental. Okay.

Speaker 3
There's an Earth Elemental?

Speaker 1
Well, it's not an Earth Elemental. Oh. They're all the same thing. Oh, that's right. Make a sense motive, both of you. Sorry, Max and Luthor. That's what I meant by both of you. 15? 15. 28. Okay. Since you were under the effects of the poison, you kind of glance over at Yzma and you kind of see that same glaze in her eyes that you felt like you probably had just moments ago before you were attacked. Hold on. Luther, Yzma seems ready to just walk into that pit right towards that far plant. And now there's a giant acid pit in between it and her.

Speaker 3
Two, three, yeah I got, uh, I guess I'm gonna stroll up to Ysmo and grab Saundir. Meander. Galavant. I'm gonna use a portion of my movement.

Speaker 1
And that's a versus your CMD. Which I'm guessing is going to be very one sided here.

Speaker 3
Don't roll one. Do I do an attack or do I use my...

Speaker 1
It's a CMB versus her CMD.

Speaker 3
That's right.

Speaker 2
Because you don't have to roll anything. Good news. Oh, damn it.

Speaker 3
What's my C, M, heart, 36. Yeah.

Speaker 4
You grappled? Yeah. In all the ways one can be grappled, I am grappling. Max. Uh, you're acting not like this.

Speaker 2
Okay. Well, let's start hitting things. Okay. Um, well, let's chop this thing.

Speaker 3
My next was, my next is just talking to you the fuck out. I have to declare it. Uh, 35? 35? Yeah. Okay. I think three hits would put you on counts. 31? No. but not dead because I don't have to.

Speaker 1
Oh, Luther, make another nature check. I don't have to. 32? 32, yes. That's a good one. Okay. That might be the magic number. 28. And is the magic number. These are known as viper vines. They are large tree-like vines that has multiple tendrils and a bitey mouth that produces acid.

Speaker 5
Bitey mouth.

Speaker 1
Bitey mouth. These ones in particular seem unnatural to you. Do you have knowledge of the planes? But you're not sure how. They are immune to acid. And they have plant traits, which for the most part doesn't really matter. With the exception of precision damage, but I'm going to be a deal with precision damage. 99 damage.

Speaker 3
I didn't, oh, yeah, it did. I give everybody that information.

Speaker 2
I will kick it down the pit.

Speaker 1
That way, if someone gets in the pit, the best part is, oh, yeah. Now there's a large creature down there that you might be able to land on. Also, no longer going to dissolve in the pit. What?

Speaker 5
I just rolled a 32.

Speaker 2
What? No one else is going to hit the acid in the pit then. No.

Speaker 1
Well, there's five feet deep of acid. Yes, but there's ten foot deep of a plant. But it's plant and it floats in on liquid. Also, it won't dissolve the acid probably. No, because there are new acid. Mostly I was just trying to... Literally just a little wrap down there in the bottom of the... I tried. Yzma, you have to get to that far plant. This one right here? Yeah, you have to get to it. Like, your life depends on getting to it.

Speaker 4
Alright, well, uh...

Speaker 1
And Luther, the dick, is holding you back.

Speaker 4
Yeah, is it my turn right now? Yes. Alright, we'll try to break free of course.

Speaker 5
Dick!

Speaker 3
Escape artist? No. Which is more interesting, because can I not counter escape artist with escape artistry? No, it would be his escape artist versus your CMD. Oh. Uh, 23 versus your CMD, which I doubt. No, my CMD is 46. Okay, yeah, I can't even roll. No, 48.

Speaker 4
A natural 20 wouldn't even do it, but regardless. As a player, I'm not disappointed, but as a character, I am. Why are you?

Speaker 1
You start attempting to wriggle out, and you are not making any progress whatsoever. Ooh, diplomacy. Oh, God.

Speaker 5
Please let me go.

Speaker 1
Please.

Speaker 5
I want to get you to put the plant.

Speaker 1
So, Luther, we're going to pull from Pathfinder 2E here. What would be your sense motive DC? So your sense motive plus 10. Holy crap. We're going to pull a little bit from Pathfinder 2, second edition, to see how this diplomacy goes.

Speaker 3
That'll be your DC. This is awesome, because that puts it at a 35. 35?

Speaker 4
25 plus 7, so a 32. Okay.

Speaker 1
So Yusuf starts saying some pretty convincing arguments here. Like, don't worry, I'm not stupid, I'm not going to walk into a pit of acid or anything. I just need you to let me go. And it seems pretty convincing, but not quite enough. The glaze of the eyes is just enough to say, you know what? There's just something about that statement that's like...

Speaker 2
Right.

Speaker 1
Doesn't make you want to let go.

Speaker 2
So, before I attack the plant, I apparently threw my shield in the air and had it float around me here. So that's what's... Uh, Lyanna.

Speaker 5
Yep. Well, the accent didn't work. Damn. Um, so... Arrows? Arrows. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Universal problem to most solutions. You're just supposed to lose problems.

Speaker 5
Alright, let's arrow the fuck out of this fucker.

Speaker 2
Got a couple choices.

Speaker 5
Well, which one's closest?

Speaker 2
This one.

Speaker 5
Seems of our choice. Shoot it. Shoot it dead. Well, actually. Shoot it dead. Yeah, close this one. Hold on. Give me a minute.

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 3
Okay. Just because my turn is going to be interesting, I'm going to throw a puncher so she can't talk.

Speaker 5
You're going to inflict damage on your own person?

Speaker 3
It deals no damage. It's a skill. It's a stop. Honestly, God. You have a skill that makes sense. It stops fucking casters from being able to cast verbal spells.

Speaker 1
You just have this ability? Yes. Monks are fucking broken.

Speaker 3
From like the first level. Honestly, when I was building this character, I was building it as a mage slayer. As a mage slayer, yeah.

Speaker 4
And that was one of the first abilities I picked up.

Speaker 1
The silent, the throat cut slay. Monks are so weird. It's not a monk thing.

Speaker 3
It's not an attack. How did you get it? Feet. It's a feat. It's a special ability. Oh, is it?

Speaker 1
There's a feat for it. I'm sure there is. Just a straight monk ability and one of your weird monk abilities that you pick up along the way. It's a combat feat.

Speaker 2
A standard action single-on-one attack cause big days for... You gotta roll your attacks. Oh, big deal.

Speaker 3
36?

Speaker 1
No, not you. I'm working on it! I know she's rolling a lot of D6s.

Speaker 5
I'm trying! Give me a minute!

Speaker 1
The D6s are... I'm letting you know because they're not as many as you think they are.

Speaker 5
Okay, what do you think I'm thinking that they are?

Speaker 1
Are you rolling holy damage?

Speaker 5
No. Well, the evil opponent...

Speaker 1
It's not an evil outsider so you don't get all that holy damage.

Speaker 5
Oh, okay.

Speaker 1
And you didn't tell me any of your attacks yet.

Speaker 5
I'm working on it. I always do it all and then I only have to worry about everything once. Oh. So...

Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm not sure where that's going from because Throat Punch is third party. Okay. It's not Throat Punch. It's Throat Crush.

Speaker 5
35.

Speaker 3
35 hit. Yep. Hits. 36. Hits. 37. Hits. 28.

Speaker 5
So I hit with at least four shots.

Speaker 3
As if the caster had broke Spell Blight.

Speaker 5
So that's a zero, zero, zero.

Speaker 3
Creatures without discernible throats. Yeah. Or multiple vocal orders.

Speaker 5
And electrical's okay still?

Speaker 1
As far as you know.

Speaker 2
Okay. Nice. But that's part of your, that's just part of all your style strikes. Yes. So it's one of all your.

Speaker 3
It's one of my style strikes. You can just do that every time. Yes. But normally they don't live long enough to cast after me, after I get done with them. So I don't bother.

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 3
and i can deal i can throw a punch without dealing damage

Speaker 5
is it weird that i need the lightning different separate okay lightning separate got it okay

Speaker 3
so basically she's like no i really need to

Speaker 5
So I got 80 before the lightning.

Speaker 1
80 for the lightning? 80 before the lightning. 80 before the lightning. Oh, before the lightning.

Speaker 3
Right.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 3
Six by six. Because I... Rabbit punch is just hilarious. I give it all time. She'll convince me to let her go.

Speaker 2
Why didn't you grab rabbit punch as one of your style? Yeah, lightning was 28. Huh? Did you grab rabbit punch as one of your style strikes? No. I don't remember what. I was gonna say, cause there's no downside to it if you're not flying kicking your turn. It's one hit with an extra quick range and an extra quick line.

Speaker 3
So the landing damage doesn't do as much as you'd hoped, nor does the arrows. Oh yeah, yeah. The one that lets me do one punch that bypasses all damage. DR.

Speaker 2
Shattering.

Speaker 1
Um... that one. So this one, the one that Yuzma wants to get to, starts moving forward to attack. Straight into the pit? Yep. And falls into the pit. Because they have... Zero intelligence? Very small intelligence. Ah, what's the downside? They'll just get acid on. We don't care. The other one, everyone's going to need a fortitude save. But don't listen to anything. Yes. Yes. Yes, again. Oh, is this the poison thing? Oh, yeah, except for, unless you're immune to poison. 22.

Speaker 2
You know how I rolled a 1 last time? I rolled 19 this time. Yeah, you made it. What's the 20?

Speaker 4
23.

Speaker 1
22? Alright, you two want to approach this thing. You two?

Speaker 4
You two. Oh.

Speaker 1
That thing there? That one.

Speaker 4
Okay.

Speaker 1
Like, it is, oh, and it falls down a pit. You still want to get to it, though. As it just... Hey!

Speaker 4
Where'd it go?

Speaker 1
Hey! Come back. You can't say something. That makes it Luther's turn. Wait, why can't I say something? Because he throw crushed you!

Speaker 4
Because Luther just throw crushed you. Oh, did you? I took damage on that or did you just stop me from talking?

Speaker 3
I just stopped you from talking. That's what I thought, okay. Anything I do is subdue.

Speaker 5
So if I...

Speaker 3
Well, thank you, but not.

Speaker 1
Right. Luther, it's your turn. You throw crushed. Do you have any other thing that you can do? Or is that your turn? Do we want to go to someone else?

Speaker 3
There's nothing beneficial here. I'm going to just take her with.

Speaker 2
Are we just going to go through that?

Speaker 3
No, we're not going that way.

Speaker 1
There are two portals in this, or three. Yeah, one we came from two others. One that came from the south. Oh, so you're just going to grab your one? Yeah, we're going to go that way. That one, or the one in the...

Speaker 5
But the pit. We got to go to the pit, because the guys are in the pit.

Speaker 1
It's true, she needs to go to the pit. She does. So Luther, you can't move that far. Luther can't carry someone? Half speed. No, because you throat punch. Isn't that an action?

Speaker 3
Yeah.

Speaker 1
So you'd have to roll another grapple to try and move her

Speaker 2
normal. Her normal movement's right there. 37. 37.

Speaker 1
That's your CMD. CMD? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. By how much? Oh. You get 5 foot plus 5 per... No, that's pushing people. That's repositioning. Uh... I will...

Speaker 4
23 is my basic... This is my CMD. So... I will take the time to just...

Speaker 5
15? You just...

Speaker 1
You just... Yeah, I'll just take the time out. Okay, so instead of repositioning, you're now considered pinned. And you're still where you were before? Yep.

Speaker 2
Up to half their speed. You can just move both of you half their speed. Right. That's 40, I believe.

Speaker 1
So. Isn't that a standard action to do that?

Speaker 2
No, it's just part of your movement.

Speaker 1
Oh, that's movement.

Speaker 2
Well, you have someone grappled. He doesn't have to do anything more. But he's still grappled.

Speaker 1
Yeah. So he can't double move. He doesn't have to hold a grapple foot. No, he can't double move because he's throat crushed. Oh, I suppose.

Speaker 2
So he can only move half his speed. I thought it was standard. He can only move his normal speed. Or up to half his speed. Yeah. So only 40 feet.

Speaker 1
I thought that took a standard action to move someone too.

Speaker 2
No, that's reposition. While you're grappling people, you can still move. Both you and them. Okay.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I thought both of those were standards. that's why I say 10 and 15 20 25 30 35 40 so you can move here max okay

Speaker 2
and I will put my hand on her shoulder

Speaker 1
toss you through the door with me you teleport into into the portal yeah into the portal all right both of you going through the portal immediately yep didn't think it was a good choice so those things does it have a climb speed well it's almost impossible to climb the pit it's super

Speaker 2
slippery. Yeah it gives you a plus something. It gives you plus eight ratio but yeah it's a DC 30 check.

Speaker 1
Yeah they don't have a climb speed anyway.

Speaker 2
So yeah um pit or portal we're going places.

Speaker 5
Yeah okay but what about the guys in the pit? Well both the guys in the pit they're not here.

Speaker 1
You still really want to get back to that pit for the next minute. So do you, Zuma. You want to get to that plant for the next minute. Um, let me take this to you.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
Is anyone taking this one?

Speaker 4
I want to get back to the plant. Sorry.

Speaker 1
I'll take this one. Well, you're getting forced through the door. There's literally, like, firemen carrying you through the door.

Speaker 4
I'm upset by that.

Speaker 1
What's that? Oh, that's that.

Speaker 2
We're back to the beginning.

Speaker 3
Yep. Back to the beginning? Not dammit. That makes sense.

Speaker 5
Wait, what?

Speaker 3
We're back here.

Speaker 5
What happened to the pit?

Speaker 3
What pit? There wasn't any pit. Just me. And that was it. So what?

Speaker 2
You came through this one here. Okay. And we went through this one the first time. Nope. That one the first time.

Speaker 5
Oh, shit. You just break your guy. I did.

Speaker 3
Easily fast. He has no axe anymore. It's a staff.

Speaker 5
Don't axe me any more questions. You can't axe anyone.

Speaker 1
You can't axe any more questions.

Speaker 2
My question, yes.

Speaker 1
Everyone roll a fortitude save.

Speaker 5
God, freaking fortitude.

Speaker 1
as you travel through the uh 20 plus 10. there's no there's no sin to take okay oh oh okay oh i keep calling them since flaw right no flaws to take it's already been token taken Swiped? Swipe or no swiping? So here's the question. We go back in the one that we

Speaker 5
passed and do we wind up in the same spot we were or does it go to a whole different place?

Speaker 3
We don't have to travel through another portal. No that's not what I said. So we're coming out of?

Speaker 5
We went in the left one. We came back on the right one. You came out of this one.

Speaker 3
Okay so that means all three of those have been... I need 42 to come out. No I take that back

Speaker 5
because we came in this one. I rolled. Yeah, I need the number. 30. 30. 20 plus 27. 27.

Speaker 1
26. 26. All right, everyone take five points of fire and five points of unholy. It's 5 and 5 unless you failed to save.

Speaker 2
28.

Speaker 1
Okay, 5 and 5. So just 5. So just 5. Come on. You gotta keep reminding them. Take the extra 5. My name is what? You guys really want to get back to that plant room? Yes. Can you hold her too? Oh wait, both of you make a will save. You took damage. 15.

Speaker 5
Wait, is that because it's not an enchantment, is it?

Speaker 1
No. So if you have... 25. 25. 25. still want to get to that plant. Like that plant, he's gonna be a plant. Got a friendly

Speaker 5
plant back in that room. Maybe, just one of them at least. Oh no, it totally is a friendly

Speaker 1
plant then. You need to get back to it. Yeah. What? I don't have that, Lily. If we go in

Speaker 5
the left, if we go in the left one, we have to go through all the rooms that are already done. If we go through the right one, we have no clue what happened. So we go back to the So we can get back to the plants?

Speaker 1
You don't have to debate this. You can just go. You need to get back to that plant.

Speaker 5
I could, but I've got an ally. So, let's go.

Speaker 4
I'm like a toddler trying to wiggle free from getting a bath right now. Pretty much. Unfortunately, I just put my hand on your shoulder. I'm not holding on to you. I can't speak, so I can't cast a spell on him.

Speaker 3
I only left her around. It's literally a... Like, you run up to them when they're in the middle of casting a spell and... No, you can't teleport away. Exactly. And that's why I took Abundant Step as well. To go after mages that try to freaking get out of my way. Can you diplomatize her?

Speaker 4
No, I decided... I determined whether I was intelligent to use invisibility in that moment to, like, just go and try to get away from him.

Speaker 2
Well, you're still with help. That'd be fine.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I can still cast a spell line while being grappled. You can. But I'll try to plumb size.

Speaker 3
I can see invisibility.

Speaker 5
I am going to use my intelligence and I'm going to play with like the Amster.

Speaker 1
You're not holding her. You're not being grappled. I just put my hand in.

Speaker 2
I literally just put my hand in.

Speaker 4
No one's stopping you from going through that portal. Still in and off. It's a 32 versus his 35 for the diplomacy. Please.

Speaker 5
Please. I really need to get out of there.

Speaker 4
I know. You seem really convincing.

Speaker 1
I'm going to scream at the top of my lungs.

Speaker 5
I'm just walking away. Like I'm a wandering person.

Speaker 1
All right, so you go through your portal. Roll a fortitude. Roll a will save after that.

Speaker 4
See, she's got it. She knows where we got to go. We got to go back there.

Speaker 5
I never do it on a fortitude. I do. I'm twisting, dude. Take down fortitude. Okay.

Speaker 1
Take.

Speaker 5
And I critically failed my will. Plus 11.

Speaker 1
19.

Speaker 5
I got a 1 plus 11.

Speaker 1
So take 9 on holy, 9 fire. You're back in that previous room.

Speaker 5
Do I take the fire too still?

Speaker 1
No.

Speaker 3
I don't know. Soon.

Speaker 2
No, it'll last a while. Longer than the rest of the stuff.

Speaker 1
Max, your friend just went back through the portal. Oh, there you go. Huh?

Speaker 2
You just lost me. I'm gone.

Speaker 1
I mean, it's just still...

Speaker 2
I thought that was going to work. I don't know. I can't hold her. She's slippery. Slippery.

Speaker 5
I greased myself down before I went through the portal.

Speaker 2
No, I'm just not very good at that sort of thing. Put the pit back in the center there.

Speaker 3
How? I guess my bigger question is...

Speaker 1
Did you move her 15 feet closer to the pit too? I'm just gonna say it was 15, 15. Yes. Um, Max. Weird. Huh. What did we do? What did you do to try and stop her?

Speaker 2
I just teleported her.

Speaker 1
Oh, yeah.

Speaker 2
I didn't... Yeah.

Speaker 1
I can't... I don't grapple real well because I have... Yeah, no. You teleported to the portal. You both came through and then she's like, well, suck this. And walked right back through. Yeah, she's an idiot. I don't know why she'd do that.

Speaker 2
Roll a sense motive.

Speaker 1
She's an idiot. I don't know why she'd do that. Okay. Yeah, why would she go through your portal we just went through?

Speaker 5
Yeah, but you have this one here. You can see that they want to go through it too.

Speaker 2
Meanwhile, Luther is... My sense motive was a net one. I'm sure she's fine

Speaker 1
You doing anything? Sure

Speaker 2
I don't

Speaker 1
Yuzma, you try to Diplomize I'm trying to, yeah Trying to appeal to his

Speaker 2
While she's doing this I'm just hitting myself With a wand to kill at wounds

Speaker 3
Okay How What is the role to Actually Tie people in?

Speaker 1
Grapple Um, grapple Actually That's it And you have to have a role You have to grapple them twice So grappling them She's already grappled so yeah. So you'd have to grapple again to rope her up.

Speaker 3
Yes. Okay. So yeah, I'm just gonna do the trusser up like a steer. Hogtie. Two hands and a leg. Because that's the worst.

Speaker 4
You're not listening. You're not listening. I'm going to remember this, that you didn't listen. I'm smarter than you in so many ways. You are.

Speaker 1
Diana. There's no one here to stop you to get to that pit.

Speaker 5
Alright.

Speaker 4
So you go straight for the pit.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 4
Listen, maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Let me go. I'll tell you why this is really that important. Oh, no. Only if you let me go.

Speaker 1
And you jump in. There's three of these things down here, so you don't actually hit the acid at the bottom. I'm waiting on them. Because the two of them are actually floating on the first one, because it floats in acid and doesn't take acid damage, because they're immune to acid. But these other two are still super hungry. And you are now right there with them. So, Max. Where'd she go? Why'd she do this? You didn't see what portal she went through I was born into healing myself I mean But it was obvious what portal

Speaker 5
You took one look away from your toddler And look where

Speaker 1
Do not lose sight of toddlers That's uh Okay Going back through? I guess so Roll a 42

Speaker 5
nowhere to be found

Speaker 1
yes yes 24 24 11

Speaker 3
11 sorry I'm also on the assumption you don't have a very high sorry

Speaker 4
no I've literally spent my entire life in books I can almost break my bones when you grab onto me Like Mr. Glass

Speaker 2
Okay

Speaker 1
When I see her going that far over there Yeah, so you like come through this portal And I start adjusting to this new room And you just see The Anna fall into a pit

Speaker 2
Well, can I

Speaker 1
Do I have a chance to hear her once with a spell Before she gets there?

Speaker 2
No, she's in the pit Like you came through the portal

Speaker 1
And that's when she was jumping in Jump into a pit

Speaker 2
Okay, that sucks.

Speaker 1
You're like, "Li-oh." Well, shit. As gravity does most of the work.

Speaker 2
Okay, well. You took damage. Make a new save. From falling?

Speaker 5
I didn't, because I landed on them.

Speaker 2
Damage, but less damage. Because she fell, what, 30 feet? So 3 to 6. On a giving surface, I would hope. So the first D6 is the lethal.

Speaker 5
Well, yeah, because the acid makes it bob, so yeah.

Speaker 1
We'll just do half of that. Okay. So take 4 points of damage and make a new will save.

Speaker 3
This isn't where I want it to be at all.

Speaker 2
Well, we hope she rolls well.

Speaker 3
Nope.

Speaker 5
You tried to get yourself killed here.

Speaker 3
Roll, roll.

Speaker 5
13.

Speaker 3
Go ahead. Go ahead and roll initiative real quick. We just kept the same initiative here. No, no, no. It's not for the reason. Just tell your dice you're rolling initiative, not...

Speaker 5
Oh, right, right, right. Sorry. Initiative. Was that natural? 14, but if I were to add 9, then...

Speaker 1
Gizma, Luthor just tied you up real good back in this chamber here. You know that portal leads to where you want to go but you're tied up

Speaker 4
Yeah, there's nothing I can do

Speaker 1
Oh, you can escape artist you can try and cut the ropes Well, you have to beat the CMD though Yeah Not if you cut the ropes You can't reach them Do you have a light slashing weapon?

Speaker 2
Well, she can't reach the weapon

Speaker 1
Oh, she doesn't even have a light slashing weapon

Speaker 4
No, I have nothing

Speaker 2
Well, I mean, she's hog-tied. She can't reach the weapon because her hands are tied up. That's what the CMD is. Or the CMB check is to tie someone up.

Speaker 5
You're flying once a day. I mean, if you were thinking clearly...

Speaker 4
I mean, I could try rolling.

Speaker 5
Rolling?

Speaker 4
I have no strength, though, so it's like, oh, my dear. I get stuck on my backpack. I'm like...

Speaker 5
I do not have my inhaler people. Do not make me laugh so hard I die.

Speaker 1
That's how we kill Leanna and Michelle. At the same time. Yeah. Oh, these things are going to full attack you.

Speaker 5
Sorry. This could be problematic. Can I roll a lot? Just like fire roll? I'm dexter. I have acrobatics too.

Speaker 3
See, I'm pretty sure you have a problematic escape artistry.

Speaker 5
I do have escape artistry up the yin yang.

Speaker 3
Right, that's what I'm saying. That would be problematic. I don't have that good of ability to grab people anyways.

Speaker 5
I still gotta beat the Wilson. I have really good...

Speaker 1
But unfortunately... Somehow you still have to... How is it the casters aren't beating the Wilson in this scenario?

Speaker 5
I am. It's just rolling low. That's true.

Speaker 1
Because you could get hit once you're in the last. Yeah, that was one.

Speaker 2
Because Walter was such a pushover when it comes to Sames. I made this one not a pushover when it comes to Sames. What's your EC?

Speaker 5
My EC is...

Speaker 2
Touch AC? Nope, regular AC. AC to being a bit by... This is... Okay, now I gotta figure this out, because I don't know why it says 27/31.

Speaker 5
Touch AC. Chris, help. It says 27/31, and I don't know what that means.

Speaker 1
Either way, the bite missed you.

Speaker 5
I don't know.

Speaker 1
Even if it's not the lower one.

Speaker 5
Right. I don't know why OB slash...

Speaker 2
It should probably be 31, I mean... It's 31.

Speaker 3
31. The other one's your touch AC. 31.

Speaker 5
Well, let's see. It's a touch underneath 18. That's why I'm...

Speaker 3
Oh, the flat foot.

Speaker 5
Flat foot's 19.

Speaker 3
Then I don't know why you would have two ACs. I don't know either. Because it doesn't make sense. What's the number we're looking for?

Speaker 1
31. Oh, it's a push. Twenty-fold by one. So that one missed. So these things start full attacking you, but since it's so crowded for them in here, I was giving them a penalty to all their attacks. Probably going to take a penalty, I think. They're large creatures. The one that started to snap at you and whipped four vines at you, all those missed. The other one whipped four vines at you, all missed, but it did get a chunk of your side. You will save. Roll a gishiff.

Speaker 5
You will save, right? That's what I said too! I did roll a gishiff! And I got a 26.

Speaker 1
Alright. You no longer want to be near this plant. Oh, it's turning.

Speaker 5
Why? It's flying!

Speaker 1
It's not your turn. Do you need damages separately? Do you have any things? DR, resistances, etc, etc.

Speaker 5
I have versus enchantments and...

Speaker 1
Take 22 physical damage.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 1
And... Uh, five acid.

Speaker 5
I'm trying to math. Hold on. Nine.

Speaker 2
Twenty-seven.

Speaker 1
Luther is probably staying with you, so we'll go back to Lyanna. Who no longer wants to be near these things. Nope.

Speaker 5
I'm flying.

Speaker 1
Hold on. Did they have Okay. You're leaving?

Speaker 5
Yep. Up and out.

Speaker 1
Withdraw?

Speaker 5
Fast as I can.

Speaker 1
You have to concentrate to cast...

Speaker 5
It's my Celestial Armor. I do have Fly as a spell as well.

Speaker 2
Probably a good thing, but you might as well use the Celestial Armor this time. Alright.

Speaker 5
Up and out.

Speaker 2
Two attacks, but put... Or at least two attacks. What's your AC?

Speaker 1
31. Something high. That one bites you. The other one doesn't not bite you. Take 16 points of physical damage. And 11 points of acid damage. And then...

Speaker 2
You're almost out of the pit. Wait no how deep is the pit? What's your castor level? I know it's weird on her case.

Speaker 5
The arcane archer or the wizard portion?

Speaker 2
The wizard level. Your total wizard level.

Speaker 5
Uh it's 2.

Speaker 2
No no no. Including all the bonuses from arcane archer. 12. 12. Okay so 60 foot deep pit.

Speaker 5
Yeah. Sounds about right.

Speaker 2
So yeah 30 feet. So you're out of the pit. - Okay. - Unless we don't die.

Speaker 5
- Right. I didn't die.

Speaker 1
- Well, you're still getting hit. - Thanks. - As their vines keep smacking you around. Um, that's not good. - Unfortunately, they missed most of their attacks of opportunity, but... - They got several? - Yeah. - Jerks. - Yeah, 20 foot reach with combat reflexes. - That is mean. - Yeah. - Uh, what's the damage on their vines? It's not as bad as there. Oh, shit.

Speaker 2
Grab.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Take nine points of damage. And what is your CMD?

Speaker 5
I knew that. I can check paper. C and D?

Speaker 1
Yep.

Speaker 5
32.

Speaker 1
Okay, and you're grabbed. Which actually prevented you from getting the second attack of opportunity that hit you, which was a critical. Probably a good thing. Ish. But you are being held by one of the divines that hit you. Luther. your... No, sorry. That was Leona. That was all the tax of opportunity. Max, she's not coming out of the pit. Oh, no. Okay. Are you standing next to the pit? Yes. I need a reflex set with a plus two.

Speaker 2
You know what? I rolled a two. I'm going down the pit. Not that I had choice because I rolled

Speaker 5
Land on the guy who's holding me

Speaker 2
So I So can I land on On Liana

Speaker 5
On me? No

Speaker 2
Can I reach Liana as I'm going down Falling

Speaker 5
Am I supposed to hold you up? Roll a reflex

Speaker 2
15. 15?

Speaker 1
She's being grappled by a plant, so no.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
But I think I know where you're going with that one.

Speaker 2
No, I just need to touch her.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I know.

Speaker 2
So, or, as I'm falling down, I hit, and then I fall back up on top. Okay. So I just got a little hand. No, I hit and then fall through a hole in the reality up top again.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 1
So, I used my second move action. You don't take anything else with you during that. You didn't bring one of those plants up back with you when you hit it, right? No. Okay. I was going to bring Lyanna. Right. But. Yeah.

Speaker 5
It broke up again?

Speaker 2
Yeah. I didn't get it very well. I was going to say it probably didn't fully dry.

Speaker 5
Poor thing.

Speaker 2
Oh, no, I can't do that. Can't do that. I don't have enough teleport left. So, I'm down there. And I have an action. Yizma. Oh, let me do my action.

Speaker 1
I thought that was your... Oh, you moved. He fell in. Yep, that was just a move action, wasn't it?

Speaker 2
Uh-huh.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
How close am I to Liana? How deep is the hole? Where are we 30 feet down? Because of creatures.

Speaker 1
Well, they're not stacked on top of each other.

Speaker 2
How can they not be? They're 10 foot creatures. They're kind of in each other.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay. So, I don't know how far up she got. Oh, yeah, she did move up. How deep is the pit? 30 feet. Well, it's... 25 technically, because it's 5 feet of acid. You moved up 15 feet when you got snatched by the ankle. okay um so plus the 10 feet 15 plus 10 25 feet from the bottom oh so wherever that is

Speaker 2
25 feet from the bottom so she's about five feet from the top from the lift yeah okay so i i didn't have to go before i even get down to the pit i could just reach her yes yeah probably well can you reach her i have 10 oh i would have been falling but as soon as i touch her because she's there, she's within reach at the edge of the pit.

Speaker 1
But you still filled that edge of the pit.

Speaker 2
Yeah, so before I even get to the pit, she is within reach.

Speaker 1
Because I have a ten foot reach. Ten foot reach, but she's five feet down. Yes. So you'd have to get to the edge of the thing.

Speaker 2
So as I reach her, I can grab onto her because she's right there. She's not halfway down the pit. Right, and that's the second reflex what you missed. I was thinking that would be a lot harder if I was falling most of the way down the pit. You were falling. You did fall. Okay, sure. Okay, so I can get to the bottom with all of them there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I guess I get to the pit bottom or half most the way down to the pit to the dead guy in the bottom of the pit. If I'm understanding correctly.

Speaker 1
You're 10 feet from the acid.

Speaker 2
Okay, because of the creature that's lying.

Speaker 1
Yeah, because of all the whole creature buildup.

Speaker 2
Okay. I super don't understand, but okay. I guess I'll just cast... I'll just dispel the pit.

Speaker 1
okay that's against her caster level so

Speaker 5
i can't just stop my own spell

Speaker 1
sometimes some of them concentration once again yeah oh okay so everyone returns to the surface so we have a pile of people and there's a pile of tree and people all kind of scrunched together awkwardly trying to get out of each other's limbs.

Speaker 5
Did I touch the ground?

Speaker 1
Yes. No. There is only ground. Yeah.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 1
There's only ground. Actually, she can help you there.

Speaker 5
That's my question. Oh, yeah. Am I still floating?

Speaker 2
I guess the thing is still holding you by the vine. But yeah, I am casting that defensively. I figured that. I succeed. Yeah. I figured that's what you're doing. Because I'm going to cast a level 3 spell.

Speaker 4
Yzma. Again, I'm just stuck here.

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 4
Like, I can continue to try to appease him. But the more I try to appease him, I can't beat that diplomatic denial he's got on me. 38. 38.

Speaker 1
You did pick up that this poison effect seems to wear off if the victim is in pain sometimes. It's a little bit damaged. But you did pick up on that.

Speaker 4
Right. Is it that I like giving people pain or that it helps in this case? I don't know. But anyway.

Speaker 1
I don't even know where we are anymore. Luther, maybe? Well, yeah, I think so. What's their turn? Um, they're gonna spend the turn untangling themselves from each other. Okay. So you're no longer grappled, and they've untangled themselves. Okay. And that's their turn. Okay, cool. Um, Leona, you're on attack. Oh.

Speaker 3
I'm just gonna push you over on your back again and be like, wait here. and I'll run through her. Wait! Did you just push her down the stairs? No, just on her back.

Speaker 2
The stairs are like right there.

Speaker 5
She's not going anywhere.

Speaker 3
Because before she was trying to roll over, I'm just going to put her back to neutral and run through the ladder.

Speaker 1
Alright, roll up for the two saves. As you go through the portal. Three, four, five, six, seven. Eight.

Speaker 3
That's 50 feet. 15. Uh, give me another 30.

Speaker 1
Take 6 and 6. Okay.

Speaker 2
Do you do your acrobatics so you don't get attacked?

Speaker 1
Oh yeah, how close are you getting to the... Oh, you're coming right where...

Speaker 3
Uh, no, I'll stay with... I'll stay, make sure I can't be hit by them. Okay. But in the range so that I can...

Speaker 2
Flying kick next turn.

Speaker 3
Flying kick in next turn. What? Sorry.

Speaker 5
I opened the wrong thing.

Speaker 1
This combat was a lot more complicated than I thought it was going to be, I'll be honest. The pit really threw me off.

Speaker 2
It does that.

Speaker 1
Also, the fact that the poison lasts for a minute. Problematic, yeah. Max. No, be honest, sorry. First, then Max. You're not grappled because the things kind of moved away from each other. How do you want to do this? You know these things can attack multiple times. And you're right within their reach. You're right within tasty distance.

Speaker 2
If you shoot, they get to attack you each time you shoot. Tasty.

Speaker 1
Tasty. That's my thought. Yeah, you're in tasting distance of both of them.

Speaker 2
Am I still flying? You are, but you know every time you try moving. You can try acrobatics, maybe. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Acrobat flying? A number of acrobatics. Or the fly skill. Whichever, your choice. Acrobatics or fly.

Speaker 5
Fly skills higher. Okay. Why?

Speaker 1
How come I know what it is? Versus their CMDs.

Speaker 5
Versus mine?

Speaker 1
No, their CMDs.

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 1
33. 33. That is not good enough. Damn it. So, they both try and take a bite out here. They don't have that penalty anymore. They are detangled. What does that... That's going to miss. Here, AC. 31. That one's going to hit. Take five points of... I think they do bludgeoning damage. Per bite. From a tree. A tree bite. Two minutes magical. and take 15 points of acid damage. - Oh, wow. - That was near maximum acid damage. - Three dice six. - Was it ball? But you do move five feet further from them.

Speaker 2
- Oh, okay. Are these things, oh, this is not mind affecting. These guys are shaking.

Speaker 1
- These guys are shaking?

Speaker 2
- These guys are shaking. No, no, no. It is mind-affecting. I was wrong. I was wrong. It's a fear of mind-affecting effect. So yeah, they're probably immune to it. Just because they're intelligent trees doesn't mean they're not trees enough to be immune to things.

Speaker 1
They are barely intelligent trees. But yeah, I do have a friend. Like they are ant-caliber intelligent.

Speaker 2
Which is enough to be considered intelligent. But does that mean they can be affected by mind affecting?

Speaker 1
As vermin traits. No.

Speaker 2
I didn't think so. But, you know. Hope springs eternal. It's not actually a light. I'm not really relying on this ability being particularly good.

Speaker 1
As you just remembered it now.

Speaker 2
Well, it's basic. It should actually be try with all of us.

Speaker 5
What?

Speaker 1
You moved five feet.

Speaker 5
I thought the flying was my turn

Speaker 1
You have to make a flight check To prevent the attacks of opportunities

Speaker 2
You move 5 feet, you got hit once What are you doing now? You move 5 feet of your movement, speed of 60

Speaker 5
Can I move further?

Speaker 2
You can keep getting hit though That's the concern

Speaker 5
Alright

Speaker 2
Are you on the ground? If you're not on the ground level maybe going invisible might help

Speaker 5
I'm still flying

Speaker 2
so yeah I mean maybe going invisible might help I don't know I'm guessing because at least I'm going to dimension my door

Speaker 5
as close to the exit we need to go to

Speaker 2
we don't know which exit but you can dimension

Speaker 1
concentration check which is what your level plus your caster level plus your Modifier.

Speaker 2
Plus...

Speaker 1
And if you have combat casting, plus 4.

Speaker 2
Oh, for casting defensively?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Okay. I mean, she's still in range, so she's casting a spell.

Speaker 5
I don't have combat casting.

Speaker 2
Well, I don't either. It's usually not very useful. It's plus 4. It's plus 4. It's useful.

Speaker 1
It's useful a lot better at lower levels. So it's 12 plus what? Plus your modifier. Plus 5?

Speaker 2
Plus 17. So, don't roll the shitty. Roll your initiative.

Speaker 5
Initiative. Alright. 12 plus 29 is...

Speaker 2
Enough.

Speaker 5
41.

Speaker 2
41? Yeah. Definitely enough. What do you want to be?

Speaker 5
Math!

Speaker 2
What do you want to be?

Speaker 5
Closer to the... Yeah.

Speaker 1
Out of reach. Out of reach. Yes. Out of reach. You have found yourself out of reach. Max, you are in reach. I am in reach. And I think that's where you want to be. And some are they Are either of them hurt at all? Both of them are hurt One is hurt more than the other The one that's hurt more I'll hit first Okay

Speaker 2
Yes, 35 hits Yes 37 hits Yes Confirm a critical Shit Could have had my first critical Oh no But it hit and probably not 9 plus 7 to 8 I was hopeful because the first critical would have been fun anyways that one's very average 10 16 13, 16 plus 13 is...

Speaker 5
- Can you give me that full total?

Speaker 2
- I will, I will. 16 plus 13 is... - You're not doing it, yeah. - Elemental, right? - 29, okay. No, not yet.

Speaker 1
- Okay. - Then just give me the full total.

Speaker 2
- 29, 39, 41, plus... Oh. Okay, yeah. My touch was being unhelpful. 149 damage. 149? Yeah. He knows it's been kissed.

Speaker 1
Oh, it knows a lot more than that.

Speaker 4
149 damage? Yeah. Damn. Tickle? That's three of my lives. Yisma. Yeah, no. We're still here. You're by yourself. Yeah. Now I'm feeling a little betrayed by my friends. We left you behind.

Speaker 5
I have a choice. Except for Liana.

Speaker 4
She was obviously doing what I asked her to do. She didn't take me with, so I am feeling a little betrayed by that. But not as betrayed by being tied up by one of my friends.

Speaker 2
And left on my back.

Speaker 4
And left on my back. Inhale. Inhale. That will not go over well with my family.

Speaker 1
At least he didn't shoot you with an arrow. That's very true. Small fingers? So far, only Max is the one who hasn't betrayed you fully. Just left you. He just left you. He didn't betray you yet.

Speaker 2
He went to go help Leanna.

Speaker 4
I'm just sitting here waiting patiently. Is there anything interesting I can see while I'm talking around? A whole bunch of damn souls.

Speaker 1
Two of which are still on racks.

Speaker 4
Are those kids over there?

Speaker 1
No, those ones aren't children.

Speaker 4
Two dead... Did you actually get to read the description from here yet or no? Yeah, that was the first chamber. Oh, that's right. We're back on that floor. That would have been really bad.

Speaker 1
Had there been devils in here attacking you. That's right.

Speaker 4
That's why it looks familiar. Okay. So we're just trying different portals at this point.

Speaker 1
Yes.

Speaker 4
Got it.

Speaker 1
Well, sort of.

Speaker 4
It's a maze.

Speaker 1
Do you have any spells that you can have?

Speaker 4
Nothing. Nothing that doesn't require me.

Speaker 1
Nothing that doesn't require that concentration checkup.

Speaker 4
Either a wand or some sort of somatic. And you have no chance into your escape artist? No. I did not grow up on that side of town. I did grow up on that side of town. You grew up in a noble household. Yeah, but not for needing to get out of things like that.

Speaker 2
Oh, probably a good thing. We don't want to talk about those.

Speaker 4
If getting away from my sitter for five minutes was an escape artist check. It's one of those kind of parties. Yeah, my name. Chalaxian nobles. Chalaxian nobles.

Speaker 1
Oh, that's the kind of party, huh? Max. Is there the tastiest thing on the menu?

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1
So they're going to...

Speaker 5
Yeah, as a girl, you really wouldn't have had that kind of upbringing at all. Does a... Needlepoint, anybody? What's your issue? 45?

Speaker 1
Where's my critical fumble deck? Oh, shit. I'm okay with this. This one tried to take a bite of you, and what it did was a natural attack. Kick up dust that blinds you. It's blinded! Ah! For...

Speaker 5
Blinded by the light.

Speaker 1
Okay, well that's gonna cause it to not be able to hit you very well. I'm okay with... 50% mischance for... The rest of it's like... The entirety of its existence. Traditional. But that doesn't stop it because it is stupid. And what does... Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Speaker 5
I think you guys have a little bit too much fun over there.

Speaker 1
It can only take a move actually next round. Okay.

Speaker 4
The nice thing about end games and the campaigns is it's just about fun at that point. It's not about who's winning or who's losing anymore.

Speaker 5
If you die, it's like meh.

Speaker 1
Oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go. Here we go. What's your AC? 45. All right, where's that critical bundle there? This thing that just killed itself. Take that one out. It triple crit failed in this full attack. It's dead. It strangled itself. It strangled itself. It's gone forever. You don't get the triple crit failing around and survive. Get out of here. You're dead. You're dead to all of us. Now the other one's going to full attack you and see if it does any better. Hey, that doesn't hit, I don't think. That doesn't hit. That's pretty close to not hitting. 40 or something? 45, yeah. That doesn't hit. Let's see if the vine's getting better. Nope. Okay. Luther, you're somewhere. He's here. I couldn't see you behind Max.

Speaker 2
That's fair. I'm going to go get some more glue. Everything I'm going to kill. Possibly.

Speaker 5
I lose their will and then I'm going to kill the max though. I'm going to fuck out of myself before anything happens.

Speaker 3
Uh, does a 38 hit? Yes. - Does a 34 hit? - Yes. - Okay. Spending no, spending no key on this one.

Speaker 1
- Sparing no expenses.

Speaker 3
- No, I'm not spending any extra for this.

Speaker 1
- How many times did you hit? - Five with two crits. - Five with two crits and your minimum is 12, 14.

Speaker 3
14. There was some stuff in the fridge I thought. Don't drink the apple juice because we can't

Speaker 5
guarantee that. Yeah don't drink that apple pie. Yeah that had an expiration date of 2025 so we're gonna get rid of that when we leave. What the zeros on the door frame are those ours? Yep. Oh, alright. I didn't even know I still had stuff here. Well, I do. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Accelerator's good shit. Is Leon shooting it a whole bunch? Uh, maybe. Well, we might as well start rolling.

Speaker 5
No. Okay. Cause if not, I'm going to be healing my cell phone.

Speaker 2
Well, I mean, you don't actually have to...

Speaker 5
severely anemic over here.

Speaker 2
That's fine. I mean, no downside to pre-rolling your attacks.

Speaker 5
How is that possible?

Speaker 1
Did you triple critical fumble?

Speaker 5
No, 11, 11, 11.

Speaker 1
So you didn't triple critical fumble? I rolled all the ones.

Speaker 5
I rolled all the ones but not those ones. I know it's going to be a good one.

Speaker 2
Yeah, pretty much. I keep rolling those on saving throws, Ian.

Speaker 1
It has five attacks a round and three of them were nat 1.

Speaker 2
How does that even occur? Hey, I got my first crit threat on this character. Uh, one...

Speaker 3
149. 149? Plus dance damage.

Speaker 5
Dance, dance. Unless it doesn't kill it.

Speaker 3
Oh, it's still up. Alright, so he gets another 46.

Speaker 1
These are hardy plants. I see that. They're basically trees. Are they bleeding? Trees don't bleed.

Speaker 2
So you say, but trees also don't move like that.

Speaker 1
Plus another 18. - This is number what? - 18. - 18?

Speaker 4
- Yeah. - Yeah. - Excuse me. - Yeah.

Speaker 3
- Yep. - Back. - But I don't think.

Speaker 5
- Did you kill anything?

Speaker 3
- I did not kill him. - No.

Speaker 5
- All right, then I guess I gotta shoot.

Speaker 3
Or just kill yourself and let Max hit it because he's right there.

Speaker 5
Whichever.

Speaker 3
Good point. Whichever.

Speaker 5
I really need to heal myself. Go for it.

Speaker 3
Do that and then...

Speaker 5
If anything happens to me, I'm screwed.

Speaker 2
32 hits. 32 does. No, it doesn't. Okay. So, three hits.

Speaker 1
Minimum damage on three hits?

Speaker 2
Been over 100.

Speaker 1
Dice. It had 40 HP.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I had 36 per hit. But yeah, minimum damage is 40 per hit.

Speaker 1
Ew, the compost. It's made of people. It's one of the greatest people, too. Yeah, they're actually screaming at you on her foot. Of course they are. In pain. Because they would do that here. Every time you stepped into the center, you got that nice squishy feeling of, oh, there's people.

Speaker 2
That tracks. That tracks.

Speaker 1
We are finally out of initiative.

Speaker 5
I still have 51 points of damage even after healing a lot.

Speaker 1
And after a minute from when you initially were poisoned, you stopped feeling compelled to go to that plant.

Speaker 4
Which is odd, because I didn't know why I wanted to go to the plant anyway.

Speaker 2
14?

Speaker 4
It was important. I'll remember it. Hold on. Wait a minute.

Speaker 2
Did you get 23 back?

Speaker 5
Okay.

Speaker 2
Another 14 back?

Speaker 5
You said 23? - Yep. - Hold on, hold on, I'm on the wrong page, hold on. 51 minus, you said 23?

Speaker 2
- And then 14, yes.

Speaker 5
- Okay, that only leads to the 14 damage, I'm good.

Speaker 2
- I got some more for you. You're good.

Speaker 5
- I'm good?

Speaker 2
- You're full.

Speaker 5
- 'Cause anytime I'm going through one of those things, I'm always taking damage no matter what I do.

Speaker 3
You are correct.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm, I, that's what Wands and Cure Light Wounds are for. I got two of them, one of which is over half used now.

Speaker 5
Oh, I bought a whole bunch of them. But, I'm really like garbage, so. And I'm sure you need some when we get back.

Speaker 4
Not much.

Speaker 5
Not much?

Speaker 4
You've been okay?

Speaker 2
Yeah, I hit her for two months before.

Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Three lifetimes worth. I'm only down five. But to me, that's, I guess, that is a big deal.

Speaker 5
Okay. What's your max?

Speaker 4
My max is 66.

Speaker 5
Oof, yeah. Oof.

Speaker 2
Yeah, that's like... Okay. Anyways, life must go on, except for you. Wait.

Speaker 5
It's too good for being a diplomat, I suppose.

Speaker 4
That's all right. I'll take it. Again, I just think I'm smarter than everybody, so I'm cool with it.

Speaker 3
I'm smarter than you. I'm faster and stronger.

Speaker 4
You're also more dead than me, too.

Speaker 5
But I'm still smarter. Face it, lady. So do we want to go back to the portal we didn't see before?

Speaker 2
No, going back to her.

Speaker 5
Oh, yeah, I see that. But no, I'm staying over there. I'm older and I have better insurance.

Speaker 2
Okay, so I guess we're all going through this portal to get to here so we can go through the portal we didn't go through. Alright, I'm gonna roll some 14.

Speaker 4
Except for me because I'm already there.

Speaker 2
Uh, 31.

Speaker 5
17. I don't know, let's roll 17.

Speaker 2
27. Unless...

Speaker 1
what hell

Speaker 2
that is where he died but yeah points to hold I mean he would have done nothing to these plants

Speaker 1
oh precision yeah

Speaker 2
he would have done absolutely nothing to the plants sorry what did you guys get

Speaker 1
17 and 27 27 okay Take... 6 and 6. 6 and 6. Take 12 and 12.

Speaker 5
Are we still on the fire does damage or fire does not do damage?

Speaker 2
Fire does not do damage. That lasts for a while and I'm glad. Once we run over our boss will probably need to sleep soonish. Here in hell. I'm not saying it's a fun idea. You don't have to sleep in hell. No. No, I'll just be dead in hell. That sounds even worse, right? That is kind of the downside, yeah.

Speaker 5
You're a good person who died in hell. Me? I'm good. I'm down at home? I'm down at 25 points.

Speaker 1
Depends. You got a limbo? 24 points. It's a gray area.

Speaker 2
So the question I have is, what happened to Walter when he killed himself?

Speaker 1
It's a gray area.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I suppose it's one of those things. He wasn't a damn soul before. So, I think from his perspective, he knew he was going to his deity. Whether he was correct is a different story. Because, I mean, once you're a damn soul, you're shit out of luck. However, if you're not a damn soul ahead of time... You still contractually need to go get judged. Yes. In which case, he was not concerned on judgment. Where are we going? The north one there. The one we didn't come through before.

Speaker 1
Alright.

Speaker 2
And room one. The one we didn't go through last time. Which one is that? I think you said we went through that one the first time, right? Yes.

Speaker 1
Okay. I was wondering if anyone remembered.

Speaker 2
And then, so we'll go through this one then I guess. That one? Middle one? Yeah. Yeah. Roll four two, Dave. Yep, roll four two. Who's taking it? Do we need to take it? That's the question. We'll find out. Yeah, I feel that one. Success. Yes, we need to take it. They like their multi...

Speaker 3
I'll take this one.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 3
The northern one.

Speaker 2
This one? This one?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Okay. Luther's taking this one? Yeah. Luther's taking this one. Luther likes his flaws. Luther wants to go to hell, but not in the fun way. Which there isn't any. Luther! Kierke'n a flaw. Kierke'n a flaw of obsession! Oh, so. It's normal. Uh, Eveline has a vision of Brasaliathrune beating a servant to death with a mace after finding the servant misfiled a single book in his library. How dare they?

Speaker 4
Right? I mean, that's an important thing, I think.

Speaker 5
I, uh, justified. Sorry.

Speaker 4
I mean, maybe a little extreme, but still

Speaker 5
Right, I mean,

Speaker 4
that is a sin. It's sin.

Speaker 1
Alright, so Eveline, except for Luthorne, is fortitude. uh the walls trouble on you yeah we did that once again

Speaker 2
uh not for this room

Speaker 4
yeah you did it for the previous coming back haven't done it yet for this one

Speaker 2
okay yeah i thought we did but anyways yeah yeah 27

Speaker 4
27 also 29

Speaker 1
um okay i just did this math uh four for everyone eight eight.

Speaker 5
Eight eight? No.

Speaker 1
Eight eight.

Speaker 2
I feel bad when you have to resist elements.

Speaker 1
Yeah. Every time you have to leave somewhere. I should just stop calculating half and half and just give me the unholy damage straight and skip the rest of it. Keep your life easier. But I don't think to do that until after I've already started saying the numbers. I'm like, oh wait. You probably want a description of this location. We're in church. Or a library.

Speaker 5
Library.

Speaker 1
What? What? What?

Speaker 5
What? What?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Archways of bone filled with vortices of fire burn in the center of three of those poles. Blah, blah, blah. while the fourth holds a similar but empty archway that opens into a vast library. A plaque engraved with writing adorns the top of this fourth archway. 20-foot high brass statue of a diabolically handsome devil with a crown of thorns, which you're standing on.

Speaker 5
You're standing on the crown of thorns?

Speaker 1
Well, there's this bronze statue of a devil there. And three pairs of different types of wings stands in the middle of this anti-chip. Plans anyone? Or religion? Yeah, totally.

Speaker 5
Absolutely.

Speaker 1
Nine! Yeah, it's going to be as terrible. No? Or nine? Nine! Well, if it's nine, then it's nine. Twenty-six for, uh... Twenty-six? Is that actually working for you now? Just whispering a roll of your hand.

Speaker 5
Oh, I got 26, so I don't know.

Speaker 3
Mine's for religion, though.

Speaker 5
No, it's plain is 26.

Speaker 4
Eight for either, so... Okay. I don't know. You guys are going to get two more.

Speaker 1
So, you might have to look at this thing and be like, that's a demon. That's a weird thing that a demon's here. I mean, why is that weird? Lucas Patanus, demons here all type. Except he doesn't think it's a demon. He thinks it's the archdevil Mistopolis standing before him in statue form. I think it's the six pairs of wings that gave it away. The two bat-like wings, the two angel-like wings, and the two... Confused. What's the last pair? Confused guy. Yeah, he has feather wings, he has bat wings, and there's an image. Where the hell is the image of Mistoffelees? other type of wings. That's not bad like and leathery. Okay. Sure. I've not seen an image of him. The rest of the description of the handsome devil with a crown of horns and three pairs of different wings in the middle of the anti-jabber. Okay. the words above the archway someone can read in formal please preserve the cleanliness of the reliquary beyond this archway you can see towering bookshelves from orderly corridors that stretch out in all directions this immense chamber stretching to the ceiling 200 feet above and creating a maze of well-stacked shells. Okay. Not really a maze. It's very orderly. It is absolutely not a maze of shells. At regular intervals, pedestals display curious items, skull covered in blue gemstones, a spear with crimson feathers tied to it, a copper-headed arrow, a copper arrowhead, a small golden box with a blinking eye of jet, and even more strange and wonderful artifacts. Doors allow access to rooms beyond the one wall. The one wall. Beyond the one wall. While a glass cage stands near a large desk in the middle of the room. With a glass... Wait. While a glass cage stands near a large desk in the middle of the room. Within the glass cage, a large... It curves. Blah, blah, blah. The bench has a lectern in which sits a large but obviously incomplete copy of an ancient tone.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
And at the desk, as you guys walk through the flame portal, there is a suit of armor?

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
Sitting at the desk. Is it evil? He barely glances over at you as he comes through.

Speaker 5
Sentient? Good. Okay. Thank you for using the Burns Hall for it.

Speaker 4
Right?

Speaker 5
Do you have your library card? Do you have to apply for a library card?

Speaker 4
They have pictures, like little Polaroids on the desk of you going through one of the portals. Like, you know. Would you like to buy your image?

Speaker 2
I'm pretty much. I'm just picturing you just going through it as a zombie. because of the it hid the thing before.

Speaker 4
Or the charm?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 4
So there's a knight at this desk? Yes.

Speaker 1
It's evil. There's a knight. Hold on guys, I got this. At that desk.

Speaker 4
This desk here? Yep.

Speaker 1
You can put a pawn of some kind.

Speaker 4
We'll put this number. No, not that one. I got this Turn on the charm

Speaker 1
He's writing in a book In a ledger, you would guess

Speaker 4
Magical aura?

Speaker 1
Any blind sense

Speaker 4
Going on around the rest of this? Like any invisible or otherwise Undetectable things?

Speaker 1
No Okay Well, there's a number of souls in here Who are cataloging books away books. Yeah. They actually, of all the chambers you've seen with tortured souls, this seems the best outcome

Speaker 4
possible. It's great because it's torturing them. It's torturing these souls because these are the unread. The uneducated. They have no idea why they're illiterate. I don't even know what this says and why it's so heavy. Alright, so walk up to the desk. My good... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. We're going to roll up some diplomacy here. 35.

Speaker 1
35. Do you have knowledge of planes?

Speaker 4
I do. Go ahead and roll that. As terrible as it can be as a 7. 7 total? 7 total. Yeah, I rolled a 3. Oh. A 4. I rolled a 4. Do you have knowledge of planes like I have knowledge of religion? It's one rank. Technically true. It's probably a double. I've heard about these plane things and I'm curious I don't want to look up more of the plane

Speaker 1
I have heard the minimal amount of reading about the planes

Speaker 4
No, everything I've learned is from everything Luther's been telling me this entire time So it might be a demon sitting at this desk? Yeah, so on one of my level ups I'm like, you know what, I'm going to put something in the planes because Luther's been telling me all these things about demons About demons So I know enough now

Speaker 1
It barely looks up from its work That's because I never gave you my name Oh, I apologize. Can I have your name? You may not have my name, but you may call me Fenbrin. Fenbrin? Yes, you may not have my name. May I have your name? Well, no, but you can call me Yzma.

Speaker 4
Very well. Are you sure that I can't have your name? No, for whatever reason.

Speaker 5
I like my name. It's fine. I'm attached to it.

Speaker 4
Tell me more about this place. What is this place? I think I'm on the wrong floor, but I don't know. I think you're on the wrong floor as well. Why do you think so? And then let's compare notes on why I think it and then why you think it. Because you're bothering me. Oh, well that's not very fair. Why do you think you belong in the reliquary of Brazali Thrun? Because I'm actually looking for Brazali Thrun. That's interesting. No, he's not here.

Speaker 1
Wait, where is he? He's at the top of the tower. I believe this was explained to you on your entry into the tower.

Speaker 4
It probably was. Wait, which floor is this again? I'm asking outright.

Speaker 1
You don't know.

Speaker 4
That's why I'm asking him.

Speaker 1
Oh, sorry, I thought you were asking. So he said the floor above, right?

Speaker 4
Is where Thrunas?

Speaker 1
Now he's at the top of the tower, I said. You are in the verliquery. Which is which floor? The verliquery. I suppose it would be considered the sixth floor.

Speaker 4
European or American standard?

Speaker 1
Devil's standard. the illness standard there is. Very specific laws about it.

Speaker 4
Interesting. And what is it you do here? Listen, I don't talk to people like you that I don't talk to beings like you that much and I'm very interested in how fascinated you are. Let's see if you can get him to look away

Speaker 1
from his ledger. A 36. Okay. Instead of a 35. Oh, I thought you said 25. No, no, 35, yeah. Okay, yeah, he looked up from his ledger the first time. Now he's a little more impressed. Now he's, yeah, now he's slightly more, he's one point more impressed. All right, is anyone else doing anything?

Speaker 2
I'm watching in awe that someone can actually talk so clearly without making a fool of themselves. Articulately to a devil. I am. Someone would use a term articulate. Also, trying to get through this door would be hard.

Speaker 3
It's like one finger is poking through. I am going to move so that I am within 30 feet of him. Just in case.

Speaker 5
Just in case. I'm going just in the doorway.

Speaker 1
So yeah, he did look up on his letter and actually made eye contact. I thought he just came out the first time.

Speaker 5
Just kind of like, how's this going to go? It's going to be a fight. I don't have diplomacy for shit, so I wasn't going to go. Oh, it was, what is the purpose of this floor?

Speaker 4
The requer...

Speaker 1
This is where we keep the records of everything that Brasoli did in his lifetime.

Speaker 5
But for a 36, I probably know what it is.

Speaker 1
And what he hopes to accomplish in his after lifetime.

Speaker 4
Oh, interesting. Where is the section about after lifetime? I am curious.

Speaker 1
Well, that one's still being processed, shall we say?

Speaker 2
Excuse me.

Speaker 4
Fair. I do like to know his favorite color. I do. I would, actually. Blood red. password for his bank account. That makes sense. Or that's just what he's used to the whole time. What are you willing to exchange for this information? What is your name? From my realm and I pull out a piece of copper this is and I'm ready to bluff this if I can. You pull out a copper piece. Piece of copper. This is of what we use for currency and it's very valuable and that oh my god that is a uh oh my god it's almost a max i am one off of a crit on

Speaker 1
that one so it's a 44 on the bluff um he holds out his hand curious he's got it and holds it up starts inspecting it and it looks like a copper coin it is it totally is you got it you see one Yes, but those are not as valuable as you seem to have said.

Speaker 4
And he's actually expecting it very closely. Yeah, but it's still valuable. It's still valuable. No, no, no. Yeah, I'm not saying it's the most valuable thing. I thought you were trying to... No, no, no. Just that it is more valuable than what it is, but not saying it's like... He seems to be trying to figure out how it's more valuable. I'm not trying to say this is compared to the most valuable gem in existence. I'm just saying that these are used as currency in my plane. We understand our currency as we deal in it quite a bit. Yes, and that's what I'm willing to give is currency. This? Yeah, that's a start.

Speaker 1
This is your offer? Yes. Acceptable. Thank you. The tangerine is his favorite. The tangerine is his favorite. It is mostly orange, or what you would describe as orange, but it's slightly different than...

Speaker 5
Slightly pink.

Speaker 4
You know what? I think we got all the information we needed. We needed his favorite color in order to further damn him. I am looking over at the demon like, is this working? Is he? Because I know he's not the decision maker. The devil? The demon.

Speaker 3
Who's Steve? And why am I on his Wi-Fi? Oh.

Speaker 2
I just realized I wasn't on your Wi-Fi just now. Yeah, that's what my dad set the Wi-Fi to. I just never bothered to change it. Gotcha. That would be the Wi-Fi. I was just wondering. I was like, who's Steve? I'm like reading this. I'm like, I'm not. How did I get on this? That's because you're on the not-guest Wi-Fi for whatever reason. Oh, well. It automatically connected me. Free-guest Wi-Fi.

Speaker 4
Hey, guys, is there anything you wanted to ask our friend? And I pronounced his name in the same way that he pronounced it to me. I remember that. Fenburn. Fenburn, thank you.

Speaker 2
Are there any of those artifacts he's willing to sell? Oh, that's a great question. Any artifacts that you're willing to sell?

Speaker 1
Not at this time. It's still too important for... You must keep records of...

Speaker 4
I do have an important matter. I pull out a piece of parchment and a quill and put on some useless glasses that I just... One of those half glasses? Yeah. I put them on and I say, we were doing an audit. And I'm going to bluff this in a second. We were doing an audit. We found one undammed soul down here. And I think there's another somewhere. We have to complete these records. Hold on, I'm going to bluff this. Yeah, that's not bad. That's a 36. And we're just looking where this other one is so we can get this straight on our record. Do you happen to know? You said 36 on our record? 36, yeah. Do you happen to know where this one is? I just want to make sure...

Speaker 1
Well, I don't know which one you've come across before, so I couldn't know which one...

Speaker 4
It was something in the water, wasn't it? A water thing? Desmit. Nymphoid.

Speaker 3
I think it was...

Speaker 5
Nymphoid Vegas. Nymphoid Vegas.

Speaker 4
I'm literally saying this out loud, because I'm trying to be kind of bumbling, but also, you know... Oh, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 1
The water one.

Speaker 4
I have it written down. Nesperia. Nesperia. Nesperia. Nere. I don't know. It's a Nere. Water Nymph. Fate creature. Yeah, that's the one we found. Nere is a species. We were able to catalog that one as being here. We just need the other one.

Speaker 1
And what floor did you find that one on? Oh, um. A description of the floor will be fine. The bathing pools. The bathing pools. The bathhouse. The bathhouse. Yes, yes.

Speaker 4
That's where she should be. Okay. That's where we saw her. And I just want to complete my records on where the last one is so we can consider this matter closed.

Speaker 1
You haven't yet been to the seventh layer.

Speaker 4
Not if this is the sixth.

Speaker 1
Hmm.

Speaker 4
Well, we should be there. And the name of that one? Shit, I made the DM look something up. He's going to be resentful going forward. Take a minus two on the line. Especially if it's not already in the documentation. He's like, fuck, I don't have a name. Bob. Everything's Bob. Therothren. Therothren. Thank you. And they are a... Yes, stay on that page, my friend.

Speaker 1
I will stay on this page now. Listen, if I got the bluff, I'm going to use it to my advantage. They are despicable azadi. The fallest creatures in all the realms. I believe it. Almost as bad as demons. That's a good point. Demons are azadi. Wait. Aren't you a thing dude? He stands up at that point. Excuse me. Oh, forgive me. He looks small at the desk, but he is a large creature. And he's an armor, right? Yeah, he's like full. I mean no disrespect. He's lawful guy. Seriously. Actually. And evil. The creature described as fire and metal very much fits this description. As he stands up, his armor shark's glowing with embers underneath. As you straight up called him a demon. I meant no disrespect. How could that not be disrespect? I just said demons and desonies are the foulest creatures in all of existence.

Speaker 4
Ignorance is my only defense, and I beseech you. Anyway.

Speaker 1
What are we doing now? We're getting ready to kill a demon. Well, a slip of the tongue might roll initiative here.

Speaker 4
We'll see. I might have overplayed my hand. Oh, that's not bad. Let's see. It's a 37.

Speaker 1
37. No, no, no. The glowing embers underneath his armor start fading a little bit, but he's still standing.

Speaker 4
42.

Speaker 1
Oh, 42? Yeah. Yeah, the embers stop glowing entirely, and he looks like he's looking for his chair once more.

Speaker 4
I really apologize, and I will never make that mistake again.

Speaker 1
As you should. Those things are more disgusting than...

Speaker 4
That's what I've heard. Demons are pretty bad.

Speaker 1
What do you find disgusting in your world? Ah, yes. Those little... Those little... Nones? Mini people.

Speaker 5
Beanie babies.

Speaker 1
Yes, those mini people. The nose. Will Quimbleton. He's one of them. I have flames.

Speaker 4
You guys have heard of Will Quimbleton from here? Wow. Unfortunately, we have. Is he damned? No, but we do have records up to this. We do have records of him in the room. Liana's like pushing money across the table. Can you put him in the books?

Speaker 2
What does it cost to skew the records?

Speaker 1
Can I add a record? We could put him in the books if you just simply sign this contract in blood for me.

Speaker 4
What is it worth to you?

Speaker 1
What is it worth to you to damn this soul? Because we can work on him.

Speaker 2
50 copper?

Speaker 1
Get out. Listen, you've established copper is important. A single copper can get you the favorite color of Brasali throne.

Speaker 2
50 copper, however.

Speaker 1
Actually, he did quickly write up a receipt of exchange for that information.

Speaker 4
Oh, yes, of course. As he should.

Speaker 1
He signed his name in ink

Speaker 2
Just left it. Things must be, of course, documented. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Because documentation is important. It was an exchange of goods and or services. Goods for services, as normal. So he did write it up for you. I suppose when it comes to...

Speaker 4
You have a receipt. When it comes to the subject of damnation, one must be thorough.

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. I mean, one must be thorough regardless. Someone's tax records could be wrong if you didn't write it up carefully.

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Speaker 2
It's true. Someone stole tax records. It's basically the same concept. Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's why my god and Thrun's god are not enemies. They're actually allies.

Speaker 1
Actually, like, that is your symbol on your armor? Yeah, yes. Ah. Very fine.

Speaker 5
I'm surprised what Gwimgir isn't on there.

Speaker 1
And then he, like, looks at Lyanna. You're also chaotic, aren't you? Yes. Okay. She hasn't impressed him, though, so she gets the clerk.

Speaker 5
I know what he is, though. I'm willing to bet. At a 36, I'm like...

Speaker 1
37? He's an apostle devil. Okay.

Speaker 5
Well.

Speaker 4
Hey, so what's over in this room here? I see a room. I see a door.

Speaker 1
Oh, we're still working on those. You should not have this.

Speaker 5
Library, catalog.

Speaker 4
Listen.

Speaker 5
Media room.

Speaker 4
Diplomacy, almost to max. Thank you very much. So that's 45, I have minus 243. Listen, this is merely to keep us informed so that way we can stay out of those areas.

Speaker 1
Yes, you should definitely stay out of those areas.

Speaker 4
So tell me about those areas so that way we can be sure to stay out of those.

Speaker 1
We are trying to finish off the portal of justice. No, that's the wrong word. Portal of flame.

Speaker 4
I thought you were going to go in a different direction.

Speaker 1
Which will take any being to anywhere in the tower.

Speaker 4
Oh, that's a clever idea.

Speaker 1
Yes, we're still working on it, though. It's not yet complete. Somebody doesn't believe that we should have something like this in the tower. And while we have submitted several zoning records and requests to finish this project...

Speaker 4
Starting to go into Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a little here.

Speaker 1
It is not yet complete. What are they complaining about?

Speaker 4
The plan of bureaucracy.

Speaker 1
Well, Mustafelis doesn't necessarily want it to be fully functional the way it's currently designed. Some inefficiency is part of the system, he's saying? No, no, no. He just doesn't want it to be accessible to anyone that isn't Mostopolis. Understandable. I mean, rank has its privileges.

Speaker 2
Rank has its privileges.

Speaker 4
So what about that one over there, then? If this one's this special quarrel that you're eventually going to finish off someday, what's going on in that room over there? I mean, these are doors, I'm assuming, right? So we can't see in there, so I'm just asking about them.

Speaker 1
Yeah. that's the second chamber that's where we have to lay the people who can't sort books well as you do

Speaker 4
as one should as one should

Speaker 1
and do

Speaker 4
we do a similar thing in our plane

Speaker 1
also we're going to add another statue of Mistopolis in there to let people remind

Speaker 4
I keep thinking you're going to go and like That's where we fillet the souls that can't blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1
And a coffee machine. Very important. The Capimachino machine will be installed there shortly.

Speaker 2
Made using only the freshest.

Speaker 1
Only the finest blood.

Speaker 2
Only the freshest ingredients.

Speaker 4
All right. So I guess my last question for you that I can think of, unless anybody's got anything else, is which of these portals takes me up to the seventh. the seventh level. I don't want to choose the wrong one and go in the wrong area because I don't want to go anywhere that you don't think I should be. So I just want to go up to the seventh then and be finished with my audit for the day.

Speaker 1
You want to go to the seventh?

Speaker 4
I mean, I want to go up to the ninth, but...

Speaker 1
Well, we don't have direct access from this floor. To go to the seventh floor, it would be the middle one there.

Speaker 4
Where does the other one go then?

Speaker 1
The top one led you to the Hall of Penitence. And the south one will lead you to... The Containment. Containment? Yeah.

Speaker 4
What is the Containment?

Speaker 1
Oh, you'll love it. It's a brilliant place where we...

Speaker 2
We're in multisouls for energy. I mean

Speaker 1
It's full of glass tubes with putrid yellow liquid we just pickled souls there for a while and um yeah they suffer in a never ending nightmare while they are pickled slowly to perfection

Speaker 4
I like that

Speaker 1
What's your brine? What?

Speaker 5
Rhyme? Pickle? Acid.

Speaker 4
Acid.

Speaker 2
Mmm. Acid too. I don't know.

Speaker 5
Some people use vinegar. That's just a weak acid. Why don't they use a weak acid with the key to good acid?

Speaker 1
Yes. We can use... We can... We can... We can daily...

Speaker 5
I'm just wondering if, you know, there's like dill in there. Do they add a little bit of garlic?

Speaker 1
Every day, their skin and muscle melts down to bone while they suffer through the nightmares. And then they just regenerate the next day. Isn't that great?

Speaker 4
I love it. I love this bit. that we can take soul damnation and take it into a comedic aspect. That makes me just so happy about this campaign.

Speaker 1
So not only are they suffering from their flesh and sinew melting in the acid, they also get to experience the worst nightmares that they experience in their lifetimes. Wow, that's...

Speaker 5
They were truly horrible beings to begin with, and yeah, they deserve to be where they are, right?

Speaker 1
I think your standard is much different than ours.

Speaker 5
You know, they failed Thrun.

Speaker 1
Yeah, some of them even jaywalked twice. How dare they? Rules must be adhered to. You don't jaywalk in front of a Thrun carriage. You just can't do that. You do that sort of thing once and you went to kill twice. Oh, gosh. You deserve it.

Speaker 5
Well, they gotta set an example. If they don't, it would happen all the time. Yes.

Speaker 1
I mean, like, jaywalking once, you could end up in the Hall of Penitence. but twice, pickle jar for you. It's a lovely place. If you do go, I suggest holding your nose as your kind doesn't like that kind of fumes. That I believe. That I believe.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
Is there anything else I can help you with?

Speaker 4
No, you've been delightful.

Speaker 1
It has been. You really have been fine. even like knock over a book or unshevel a shelving unit we didn't even touch the artifacts I expected that from your kind chaotic

Speaker 5
I'm all about books I'm cool with books

Speaker 2
yeah she's a wizard type

Speaker 5
yeah but I bet your

Speaker 1
spell book has no organization whatsoever

Speaker 5
yeah

Speaker 1
kind of the name of the spell and a number next to it

Speaker 2
Oh, how do you organize your spell book? First by alphabet.

Speaker 1
Then by how many souls you've killed with it? Then by how many people I've damned using that spell.

Speaker 5
Technically, mine's by level, and then by type, and then by alphabet, and then by whether or not I've studied it long enough to make it into my memory.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 5
I try to keep working. How simplistic. Where's your doing decimal? But do you want to know how hard it is to bring those back when you're trying to shoot someone on top of it? It's not easy.

Speaker 1
If I listed a number from the Dewey Decimal System, would you know what genre of spell it was?

Speaker 5
Possibly.

Speaker 1
Divine. We'll a bluff check on that.

Speaker 5
Don't make me. That was almost on my computer. Don't do that.

Speaker 1
I trapped on.

Speaker 5
It's a divine spell in my book. Dude, I just critically failed that one plus six. well no because I get plus two for if it's Thrun as well or four if it's evil outsiders

Speaker 1
yes I don't believe I don't believe that you know what the Dewey Decimal System is

Speaker 5
that I do know do I necessarily know which one

Speaker 1
Diana doesn't know

Speaker 5
letters and numbers it's on the side of the books

Speaker 3
letters that's like

Speaker 1
letters and numbers this is why I talked to you he turned back to the yes and I suppose you have some organization assistant that could teach her for your whole spell book you are doing oh wait no you did bluff about your art didn't you nevermind I did I was gonna say wait man you should be rolling checked too about your audit. I have been.

Speaker 4
But yeah. I think we're pretty much finished here. Yeah. Thank you very much for your time. I used to pronounce his name in whatever closest native tongue that I heard him say it. Bambro. Oh, okay. There's no special pronunciation to it?

Speaker 2
Weird. Did Paisal write this one? Yeah. Weird. There's no extra X's. There's no extra... There's no spitting somewhere inside the pronunciation?

Speaker 1
We're not demons. Gross. They have very...

Speaker 2
Ah, fair enough. Yeah, we were just talking about the metaphysical underpinnings of reality. Yes.

Speaker 1
Demons are very garble language.

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1
Infernal is very elegant.

Speaker 2
So we wanted to go straight this way, if I understood correctly. i don't which one was the pickled one the middle one is the one we're supposed to go to to get seven

Speaker 4
the one you're standing by just a second ago was the pickle room and the other one goes back i think

Speaker 2
we came in through the north we came in through the north yeah okay so let's go straight so it is

Speaker 1
currently five o'clock i suppose if that matters to me it does it matters to me um then this is Probably a good actual ending point. Okay. Because I don't think I'll do another layer.

Speaker 2
Were any of those artifacts not evil? No. Okay. Oh, well. No, not.

Speaker 1
Not, not evil. They were, none of them were evil? None of them were not, not evil.

Speaker 5
They were all evil. All of them, every single one. The trucks. Well, yeah, they're an evil library. We're kind of like the librarians in reverse.

Speaker 4
Can I ask about this out of character? Which one? Like this, was this supposed to be, did you think we would be more of Mr. Stabstab over there? Punch Punch, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1
No, actually, this room you could peacefully have gone through. As long as you did not try to enter these rooms or get to that book behind the glass. Any of those acts automatically triggered a counter.

Speaker 4
I am curious about the book behind the glass, though.

Speaker 1
Were all those artifacts just things that were horribly cursed? Or were they just... They're metaphors for a bunch of things that sort of live in life. Okay. That tracks. A lot of this is metaphor. The actual books, if you had gone through the books, the actual books were different events in his lifetime. But the artifacts were metaphors.

Speaker 3
Can you bring up the maps we've already been to? Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2
We've been to this one, this one, this one, and this one.

Speaker 5
You gotta make them bigger. You can't sit squat.

Speaker 2
We've been to this one, this one. Okay, hold on. Slow it down. Go to the bathhouse.

Speaker 1
There's another portal over here. Yeah. That came in. Right. Someone's making his notes updated. Probably a good idea.

Speaker 5
I didn't do too many notes this time.

Speaker 1
I did put March and April's up on Facebook. You did? On Friday or Saturday. I'll have a little more. Because I figure we're pretty close to the end here.

Speaker 2
So... And just inside, does it work? Like two sessions...
