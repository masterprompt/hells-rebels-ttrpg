descended down over 2,000 feet below the surface of Kentargo to the Underdark.

The Darklands, I guess they're called. Underdark is now copyrighted, apparently.

And there you entered a large cavernous chamber. Overdark. The Overdark. Over the Underdark.

You have to climb down a little small cliff and we're ambushed by a ghost dragon, aka

Wormwraith that blasted you guys quite a good deal.

That is not fun breath weapons and violets towards your general being.

That was such a tough one.

My four are cutting the seven points.

After that, your friend Max turned into cardboard, and you continued descending down into the darkness.

You came across a giant skeleton and figured that it was a red dragon that used to live down here.

And that brings me to what I was trying to mention earlier.

That's the wrong one.

So in the chat, back from last session, we have...

So you guys, Yizma brought some powder, some Bone Dragon with her back up to the surface.

You grabbed your horn and/or tooth and took the sample to the Albaster Academy who offered

you 3200 platinum pieces for a detailed description of the location and salvage rights to what

remained. And none of you guys jumped on that offer, so I don't know if you guys took it

in the end or not.

Oh, talk about that. I don't remember that at all.

It's in the chat.

He added it later on, so I gotta take a peek.

Yeah, December 21st.

I thought it was an announcement, not an offer.

Oh.

So yeah.
