2025-12-21
(we are here seeking out the soul bound feign that has the heart to prevent him from becoming a genocidal loki)

Used a restoration scroll on Liana to remove her temp negative levels.  I feel pulled in directions innately, so follow that. We come across the bones of an elder red dragon.  I collect one of it’s horns (to sell as dragon bone dust), and Luther collects a horn.  Upon investigating the bones, we determine it died from lightning (which was odd) somehow.  We find a detached femur bone a ways away from the dragon. 

We loose track of Liana for a bit, and go to look for her in a chamber where someone (some point in the past) brought in some bodies of various humanoids and tore them up.  The bones were strewn around the chamber.  Sending my Familiar, Kronk, up to one of the unreachable chambers above us, we find a dragon horde.  71,500 GP (17875 split 4) worth of coin, 5,300 (1325 per player) platinum, bag of gems worth 51,000, 2 sculped busts of people worth 1,500 each (13500 split 4).  

We make note of this dragon horde and take some stuff for ourselves.

As we move on into the lower caverns, we find an area where the mushrooms aren’t growing and find some shadow “demon” panthers.  Eventually we see the shadows become more profound and 2 shadow golems climb out of the pit nearby.  After defeating the golems, we discover a symbols (needlell, the neighboring area of kintargo), Ilvarandi family (pro thrune, but not enough to have given such treasures, but they could have done it for a close enough relation or friend).  

Liana is blind, and we need to get her fixed.  We teleport to the temple Shelleni.  We make some donations to have Liana healed up. 



2025-10-26
A small bat flew out of the tree and transformed into a large creature.

We begin to battle this thing for a few rounds before I charm it and we learn it (Skalkie, the Pababola) is here to feed on all the evil energy in the city.  As Max begins to send him to hell (nicely), Luthor, who is deaf from a fumble, saw us say “hell” in silver sign and begins to end the creatures existence.  Max is able to send it to the 9th circle of hell where it should be able to feast on evil and suffering to it’s leisure.  

We feel the gloom/fog begins to dissipate.  

The bells of the asmodeus temple ring out however it sounds like a monstrous heartbeat rings out in the ringing of the bells.  I feel a pull on my being towards the west, and have an understanding where the heart is located.  The pull feels familiar, similar to when I was pulled into the jar.  We walk to the graveyard in D6, which is where it seems to lead us.  Pulled to a tomb a plain looking crypt, overgrown with ivey and unmaintained.  

Level 17

We investigate the crypt of Esberdeen.  The center of the crypt has an illusion and transmutation aura in the center where a sarcophagus should be (or appears to be).  We determine that it’s an elevator.  “Welcome to the mouth of souls, give your gift to the dowager of illusions, and be shown to the bowels below” a voice rings out.  We ask it questions.  Luthor determines: Mahatula - one of the 4 hag gods of hell.  Luthor cuts himself, offering his blood to activate the elevator.  2,000 feet down the elevator (20 feet for every 6 seconds took 10 min to traverse).  In a chamber, a large set of double doors to the east.  We open the left door.    We cross a bridge and encounter a gargantuan ghost dragon that takes massive damage from the party (Causing negative levels in some).  











2025-07-20
We all wake up and have breakfast.
We’ve narrowed down the area of interest to a 50x50 mile location (250 square miles).  As we exit the hideout, we hear wolves  in the distance in O2 (docks), we head over to investigate.  We encounter hell hounds (war hounds) in some abandoned ruins.  They seem emaciated, and are the size of horses.   We make friends with one of them and dispatch the others.  Sadly, the one we made friends with had nothing to share, so we send it to another plane.

We go for some fish and chips “Worlds Famous” place!  

As we head to the tower district we are approached by an angry mob.  The present their leader Iron Maine (dwarven woman), Athana Iron Maine.  We intimidate the crowd but Athana stands her ground.  Max teleports in with the city guard.  They discuss the “gloom” that’s overcome the tower district.  We ask Iron Maine to help us learn about where she is staying (maybe the gloom is coming from there?).  She takes us to her workshop.  We determine that the gloom aura is still at the edge of the temple district at their workshop.  Max attempts to triangulate the edges of the gloom aura.  

We narrow down some of the locations where something could be causing the gloom and someone suggests a creature called a Popobala might be the cause.  Max summons some creators that detect some bat like creator hiding in a tree.  


2025-07-06
3p
We meet up at the opera house near J1 (Yzma, Max, Luther, Ilana)

We head to the focal point (as we can tell), and the pain stops briefly.  As we walk past a building, the building seems off….  A small-ish playground type of building, looks like a replica of a prison.  Giving off enchantment, conjuration, abjuration magic.   

Once Max and Yzma get closer, they disappear, and appear in a prison with Thrune as the chief torturer and all of our victims around us chanting at us (individually and not within eyesight of each other).  Yzma is in a cell.  

Upon exiting the prison, Yzma finds her group being attacked by “Barbed Devils” and begins to aid her group by charming one of them.  The rest are dispatched as we question the remaining one.  He doesnt give us much information so we take him out.  

We walk down the street a bit to see if our pains have diminished.  They seem to have.  We go back to Lothor and ask about further reports:
Increased suicides in red roof and yabalis district - Lt Alkline
Lt. Elevon - researching castle and Jarvis district
Lt Zaltan - Investigating the wailing
Lt Lanis  - Investigating the wolves.
Lt Harlow - Investigating the Temple district

We speak with Lt Alkline - Upheaval in suicides.  Bodies found in streets with knife wound across the throat.  We learn nothing new

8a
Max performs the Commune spell to narrow down where the soul anchor using 16 questions. 
Is the soul anchor in kintargo: No
Is it south of the Yolubilis River: No
Is it in the prime material plane: Yes
Is it in Rivindale: No
Is it in Chellix: No
Is it on the continent of Glarion: yes
Is Thrune’s heart in the soul anchor: yes
Is it on the west side of the map: yes
Is it south of the string: Yes
Is it on land: yes
Is it west of the line: Yes
Is it south side of line: ye
Is it west: yes
Is it west of line: yes
Is it south of Nisroch: yes
Is it underground: yes






2025-06-22
Level 16

5p
We start out just outside our base in Kintargo.

We take the signed treaty to the mayor.  Yzma feels a growing pain in her right shoulder for 20-30 seconds.  They decide to throw us a party/celebration the following day at 12p tomorrow.  We leave.

Notes on the heart of thrune:
Brazali Thrune had a puzzle box and a copy of a treaty/contract where his heart was when the group killed him.  And a copy of a heart’s harvest contract.  He might be something other than a demon/devil (according to Luther).  Thrune is technically dead (body).  They found the demon who wrote the Kintargo contract.  Moostaphelies (the lord of the 8th layer of hell, not easy to get in touch with) wrote the heart’s harvest contract.  They must return the heart to Thrune’s body, then kill him again to kill him permanently (prevent him from turning into a Genesis Loki).  

We head to the base in the lucky bones to review the contracts, the clockwork cage, etc.  The heart’s cage looks well made.  Hidden conditions:
Thrune dies of misadventure: souls of his and his servants are forfeit to Moostaphelies
Heart is returned to body while he is dead, his transformation will be prevented.
Thrune removed his own heart

Need to find the heart:
Luther killed Thrune twice, last time was at a temple of asmodaeous.  

We head to the head of the guard (Capt Lothor, a gruff dwarf)  and ask about where the body of Thrune went.  We discuss the heart to some detail.  We discover his body was returned to Chillax per burial procedures (given to Abigal Thrune).  He also tells us reports of Demons/Devils running a muck in areas of the city.  They have NOT been reinstating the tortures (not sure what that means) in the prison in the castle district.  He shares that he was feeling the same growing pains as Iliana and Yzma.  Says there are other reports!  Reports of wailing at night, wolves spotted in Kintargo.  Sightings of the face of Thrune peeking through windows.  And suicides in the red roof area.  

One lead:
Opera house was Thrune’s base of operations.  

We head to the opera house
7p
We go to the 3rd floor where the living quarters of Thrune would have been.  We find a hidden compartment in the bed and find notes (unknown handwriting) about a soul anchor.  The anchor brought Thrune to Kintargo in the first place (before he became lord mayor).  Says he traveled to the soul anchor and performed the final step towards his plans.  “Soon these fools will feel my wrath” (dated 3 weeks before the ruby masquerade).  This connects to some notes on a soul anchor a few days back (which are sitting at our hide out).  We find nothing else of interest in the opera house.  

Head back to hideout.
Comparing the two books we have on the soul anchor.  
Thrunes interest in the soul anchor is what drew demons to Kintargo
Soul anchor allows one to retain memories after death
This is what most religious people dislike as it goes against what death should be
One diary expresses how furstrated the researcher got when trying to figure out what Thrune did at the anchor

Head to bed!

8a

Clove and hoof society is a food pantry for tieflings.  We should help them?  The headband suggests that it will not give us results towards the soul anchor. 

We determine, from Luther’s dreams, that we should “Beware of the tortured to find the anchor”.  Using the headband, it suggests that something in the castle district will help us lead us to the soul anchor.

On the way, pain in Yzma’s jaw for 30 seconds and then nothing.

Kintargo Map

Asking the headband if exploring the castle (C1) will reveal the location of the soul anchor, it replies woe.

We walk around C2 and find nothing of note.  We talk to a soldier who directs us to Lt. Alabon who would have a compiled report/ledger of all the tortured reports.  Lt Alcolin should be at the HQ, however Lt Lanlis is the bloodhound investigator.  We determine that all the phantom pains are happening between C and J districts.  

Meanwhile, two knuckles on Yzma’s pinky flare up.  

We determine that the J6 area is where the majority of these tortured screams are heard.  We head to J6 and investigate a bit.
10a
Upon investigating J6, it turns out J3 and C5 areas are where more concentrated areas are.

12p
We head to the party near the opera house (park south of opera house).
During the ceremony, Ilana begins dancing as her pants fall down for 18 seconds.  Yzma notices that the spell irresistible dance was cast on her by someone.  The rest of us try and divert the crowd (as Ilana is pointing her bow at unarmed civilians) by posing in action poses.  

2p
Some of the towns people report wolf howls coming from O11 area, along with insatiable hunger pains.  Y & R districts have a few dead bodies being reported (throat cut and knives); people are afraid to come out of their homes.  We determine that C5, J6, and J3 are the focal points.  

We head towards the focal point of the triangle. 

Luther heads to pick up Ilana while Yzma heads to the focal point of the triangle.

3p
We all meet back up around J1 (Ilana, Luther, and Yzma)




2025-05-03
Yzma goes to her room, then goes invisible and wanders down to an open door down the hall (corner room).  Checks out the north east hallway, guarded by the barbed devil.  Then goes back to bed.

Awakened by some noise, but decide to go back to sleep. Eventually waking up to the sound of “axe”.  Going into the hallway, the scribe points at Liana and Yzma and says “Arrest them”.  Liana casts obscuring mist; yzma’s invisibility fails; yzma pulls Liana into the nearest room.  

We put someone to sleep in the room, then search for a window. Finding one, then joining Max and Luther on the roof.  Turns out the lead negotiator has been assassinated (by an assassin from Nordeburger)  and we are being blamed. 

We go back inside and confront the scribe.  We interrogate the spider woman that Luther caught on the roof, and she said “god of secresss”, something with Norderburger’s domain.  

8a

We go back to sleep and sleep to the morning.  We head down for breakfast and meet with the rep from Absololom who withdraws their offer from the table given the events of the night before.  She believes the assasination was probably by someone who wanted a war between Chillax and Kintargo to take place.  She believes that we made an enemy of the “Dark Star”.  The negotiations will continue with this person (Athena) being the new negotiator.  

12p
We meet again for the next day of negotiations. 
Topic 4: Proposition of a military alliance: chillax wants to summon kintargo in an event of war.  Chillax will come to aid kintargo if it needs aid in it’s region.  

Lost sense motive.
won the diplomacy regarding commitment of resources for each nation.
Won the bluff regarding our discretion on who we choose to go to war with on behalf of chilliax

Topic 5:Non aggression pact.  Revenelle will not make aggressions against Chilliax, magical or other.  Trusting borders.  Don't assist with war efforts carried out by other entities (even helping soldiers going through).  

Sense motive: Won!
Diplomacy: Won!  We can still sell weapons and magics to enemies of Chilliax
Bluff: Won! We can determine who passes through our lands

We sign the negotiations! And Max pops us back to Kintargo!

2025-03-16
Lord Mayor Roxis asks us to come see him before we head to the negotiation.  He asks us to keep Revinelle in a good state of power in the region, especially with Niddelle (a nearby neighboring region of necromancy) so they dont look weak.  He wants us to favor Revinelle in Kintargo’s transition out of Chillax and maintain peace.  He pulls out a seal, and to use his seal if we come to an agreement.  

Day 4 (day of the negotiation)
We have Charlotte teleport us to the “Ribb Inn”. We teleport outside the inn and do some Recon using Arcane Eye.   Of note: Male half/elf (grounds keeper?) in an office on the grounds, he seems interested in the portion of the second floor, NE corner, roof section. Upon inspecting that area (the corner suite), I dont notice anything out of place (any repairs that need to be made).   New tapestry of the Queen on the staircase.  Also the silver ravens tapestry is still up.  Many patrons.  Not noticing anyone dressed in regal attire.  Inn keeper is pinging Abjoration magic, and the grounds keeper has transmutation tools and he has illusion.  A hafling head chef (female), human female stable master, human bard looking guy coordinating something, 2  human cook assistants, 3 generic house keepers (human), 3 human gruffs (security?).  

Orlando (the inn keep) greets us at the door.  Sees us to our rooms.  Hands us 5 keys (1 for each room).  We sit down and eat.    

Eventually our opposing party arrives (all magical) except a barbed devil (named Bob) who accompanies them.  
Rigalio introduces herself, her devil is very angry with the situation, we introduce ourselves to them.   She seems VERY professional and interested in negotiating.  They have no interest in keeping Kintargo, but want a peaceful transition.  We agree to meet after lunch.

We head to the conference room.  Rigalio introduces her associates: Earl (personal scribe), Athena (diplomatic apprentice), Sable (human personal assistant)

Topic 1: Trade between Revenille and Chillex.  We aren’t a major exporter however salt (brackish waters, very valuable in cuisine), granite (very valuable, due to silver flakes), silver, and fish (salmon is prized).  (Bluff, diplomacy, intimidate, sense motive)  They want a price lock on market price (globally) and 50% of our export guaranteed to them.  We succeed on sense motive, pass on diplomacy, and fail on intimidate.  

We retire for the evening (topic 1 took several hours).  

We build a plan to have Luther semi-seduce one of Rigalio’s servants who seems to take notice of Luther.  We have drinks with their party and regale them in a good time!  

1a:
Athena wakes up luther and asks to assemble us in the lower main room of the inn.  “There are interested parties of Egorian (continent) who want kintargo to remain part of Chiliax, if interested, then concede all future negotiations with Regilao”.  She gives us 3 star sapphires (5000 gp each).  “Those involved are willing to offer to the silver ravens 200k gp, and to the region of kintargo 1.5 times that amount in us agreeing to the trade treaty, in favor of chillax”  next 4 topics are about matador gap, artistic and scholarly rights, military, and some surprise pact.  She says she isn’t with Regalio, or the queen, but with other parties..  

(33 bluff) we agree to her terms.  But Luther says something that gives her doubt, but she still thinks we are at least partially on board.  

8a:
Breakfast is served.  
We meet again with her company.  

Topic 2: Repairing of Maddador Keep (something we apparently destroyed?).  Keep should stay in Chellix hands, not prevent the keeps repair, and reparations be made regarding the destruction of the keep. 
(sense motive) willing to remove reparations.  If we take the deal of removing reparations, we go against the deal Athena offered..  We ask to table this conversation
(diplomatic success) we keep a Revendelle presence
(bluff success) equal Revendell presence in military presence to maintain balance

Topic 3: Kintargo has historical and artistic interest of Chillax.  House Thrune fears loosing theses treasures.  We want insurances that Alabaster wont discriminate against Chillax: crown requests that a letter of introduction from Thrune be honored in the artistic and academic for unconditional access. 
(sense motive success) Visitors must secure public acknowledgement to see private collection.  Also must bear letter from house of Thrune and scholarly letter from an academy to see the private collections.   
(diplomacy success) Someone of mutual public representation to give permission to access.  
(bluff success) not unconditional access to museums and schools without letter from school/museum and letter from Thrune

Dinner, we invite the opposing party for dinner.  They accept, and Yzma brings out the personal assistant’s interest in Luther.  She then centers that conversation onto Athena, challenging her to meet again (with Rigallio failing bluff and not knowing any better).  Night goes late. Luther points out 3 people who are watching our conversation from the shadows.

We meet secretly with Aethena and discover she is with the Absolem court (the capital of the land, a force of true neutral, and a representation of balance) and feels if Chelliax looses too much in their crusade they may take this opportunity to push further in to imperialism.  Turns out that Absolem sent Athena to the queen 5 years ago as an apprenticeship to help further the Absolem agenda.  Yzma says that they would like to help out Absolem in some other way other than the independence of Rivendale.  Then Yzma puts down the sapphire on the table, and heads to join Luther by the bar.  Then heads to bed.







2025-03-02
The group (Max, Gorlon, Yzma)  meets up with Liana and Luther.  Turns out Liana was paralyzed by something in the main doom room.  She regains her facilities and we head to the doom room.  We encounter some demon and fight it.

We head to the final room with a cauldron hanging in the room, we find nothing.
So we head back to the hideout (via dimension door).

We head back to see the headmaster of the Alabaster Academy, Desdoros.  He locks us in and we turn over the notes we found in professor Mengeoff.  We learned that Thrune used the soul anchor before Mengeoff.  

LEVEL 15

Next day is the start of diplomatic relations.





2025-02-02

We begin with the orb dropping from the ceiling.  Some sort of reptile thing that causes nausea amongst people.  The drow remains at the ceiling.

We find:
Ring of featherfall
Immovable rod
Wand of resist energy
100 pp
Staff of understanding
Sapphire 1000gp

Then move to (E5), find 2 demons

3 potions of invisibility x 2
Masterwork breastplate x 2
1+ Buckler x 2
Dagger of Venom x 2
We lost Liana, so Luther went out to find her (She split from the party and was dying down a pit of acid).  Max tried to dispel the aura plaguing us.  


2025-01-26
We continue to head to the Alabaster Academy to investigate the Drow murders.  We ask to speak to the headmaster Ilvynana Desdoros, and ask about the drow murders.  We determine this is a copy-cat killer (Professor Mengeoff, who was the first serial killer), and the headmaster is upset that we brought up this low part in their history.  This “blight” on their reputation.  His suggestion is to find more about the original killer to determine the motives of the copycat.  We head to the natural sciences building (where Professor Mengeoff originally taught).  He (headmaster) leads us to an office but is startled that the professor's office is open, expressing that the office has been locked and shouldnt be open.   The ward protecting the room have been cut, and some tracks in the dust leading towards an empty bookshelf.  A false bookshelf. That opens and descends down a ladder into a hallway.  

4 pillars, each radiating evocation magic.  Devil, Dragon (green dragon, living in swamps, rhino like horn on nose, amphibious, spiked tail), Cloaked Figure, Angel (all the pillar shapes).  

Devil: “Father of Hellfire” (Abyssal) - Fire
Dragon: “Nature’s wrath, forest’s toxins” - Acid
Angel: “Servant of heavenly thunder” - Electric
Dark Figure (Repier): “Death’s unforgiving embrace” - Cold

Moving the torches to each pillar, we open the first door.  Illana checks the second door, and disables the trap, and we encounter a a 3rd door.  

“For those who follow, the elements are key”
Acid, cold, fire, electric
We disintegrate all the doors and move through to the next room, with a door.
We find a teleportation room with the writing:
“Welcome to my home Silver Ravens!”

We step in, and are transported to another area.  
We find a table with a skeleton..  I am dominated, Illana attacks me.  I see a vision of the past of the guy on the table, in the past, the man above me is smiling wickedly.  I know what he’s about to do cause he’s been doing it for days to me.  “My work is almost finished, just remain conscious, I need to know every detail”, he cuts into my ribs, removing ribs, going after my heart, trying to remove it.  He is trying to determine details about my experience.  I feel my soul rise up, a glimpse of paradise.  After days of torture, I am ready to pass, and the vision is torn away, and I am trapped in blue energy, like an ocean.  Pulled down into a swirling vortex of blue energy.  I experienced the fight from the view of the jar.  The man over the top of me, benefiting from my death was Professor Mengeoff as I recall. 

We head on to the next room.  Encounter a room with a large cobra/man type thing…  
We try to talk to it, it responds, but still attacks us without provocation.  Luther dispatches of the serpent man with 184 points of damage… “All I wanted to do was talk” he says as he punches it to death.

We loot the room:
We find lots of notes in the room, books, etc. 2500gp worth of books and such.  There’s a book that’s important that we need to comprehend later (language we dont understand).
We hear a smug laughter coming from above, a drow floating above, drops a small gold ball into the room from above.  Hits the ground and forms into a stone giant (continue next session).  





2025-01-05

We head to V1 district to see lady Delacour (school for girls, was a school of etiquette for nobles originally but lady Delacour changed it for all bloodlines and not just noble).  Yzma is lead in but Max and Gorlin need to wait outside.  The lady and Yzma meet.  She says she knows nothing about any drow in the city but will keep her eyes and ears open.  We believe the drow might be in cahoots with Asmodaeus followers.  

Meeting back up with Gorlin and Max and give them the low down on the meeting with Delacour.

Mid-day:

We head to clench-jaw tavern to meet with “Flynn”(one of our own who Gorlon is searching for).  We ask Clenchjaw about flynn.  He hasnt seen him for a few days now.  He leads us to Flynn’s room and we discover signs of a struggle.  Little blood spatter (max takes it to scrye).  We notice odd burn marks on some of the furniture.  Some type of acid burns on the wood furniture.  The burn marks are shallow, so probably on there for a few moments.  The acid was removed somehow (cleaned maybe), and this happened a couple days ago.  

We decide to head to the temple of Shalenlae (T4) to talk about scrying to find Flynn (one of our own).  They mention that Gorlon’s aura is out of alignment and offer to either help him or ban him.  He (Gorlon) needs to “get happy water from the city and slowly meditate on it until it turns red” says the temple clerics in order to start the ritual to correct his aura.  We then move on to scrying for Flynn.  

Gorlon finds his ingredients for the ritual and they being that while Max begins scrying for flynn.  He sees Flynn with purposeful injuries (healing), and his wounds are being stitched up.  Looks like they are either torturing him or are trying to modify his body in some way.  Might be a temple, maybe the dark temple.  There are cots with dead people on them and Flynn is on them, and has maybe been tortured.   We then wait for Golorn’s ritual to end.  (he now has a 5% chance to cast fire magic).  

Later that day:
We collect Hero and attempt to teleport to where Flynn is.  But we cannot teleport to him.  We decide to wander around the city looking for detect magic to find the barriers for teleportation.  Instead, we go to the mages school to get Arcane Sight permanently put on Yzma. We make our way to the temple district to try and detect magical barriers.    We see Abjuration, and Evocation, spells from all the major (3) temples, Asmodaeus, Shalenlae, Zokotol (Shadow lord).   

We head back to our sanctum and wait till morning. 

Day 4 (3 days until negotiations):
We send a Raven to Flynn and follow it.  We get fire resistance from Max.  We get a note from anonymous that says someone left a gift in our temple.  So we search our hideout.  Nothing.  We decide to go to the temple of Aroden (which we are remodelling) to look around.  We find Flynn, dead on a table.  Which means someone moved Flynn here from wherever he was.  We see a faint conjuration aura on the wall, similar to the clove and hoof society where the chef was murdered.  

We use “commune with birds” to narrow down where Flynn may have come from, who delivered him, where they went, etc.  We determine that whoever delivered the body is no longer in town.  That many dead bodies are in the shadow temple but it may not be where Flynn was held/tortured.  We determine that all birds are scared of the shadow temple (T1) and something in lower V5..  

We take Flynn’s body, but it explodes as we pick it up.  The silver butcher's axe propping up his body hits the ground (its odd that that it was there, a rare weapon to have).  We take some of Flynn’s remains for future resurrection. We head to lower V5 to investigate.  Using Arcane eye, we search a few of the buildings.  We dont find anything with 1 cast…  

We decide to head to the blacksmith (Drax) and ask about the silver butchers axe.  He describes the dark elf that purchased the axe from him.  

We decide to head to the black market.  We head to an information booth and ask about the axe and who may have ordered it.  He suggested an Obsidian elf bought it from a nearby booth.  So we head to that booth and ask about the drow.  The guy tells us how odd the guy was (saying something from a guy in the black market).  Says the drow was an artist in killing folks and he was glad they (the drow and some other person with him) were gone.  Suggestions to check into the Alabaster academy.

We start entering the warehouse…  Yzma uses arcane eye to explore the warehouse.  Discovering 2 body guards on the second floor guarding a door on the second floor.  2 other people playing cards on the first floor.  On the second floor is an office where we find our boss.  We dimension door in, the boss instantly summons devils, and pops away (leaves?).  We begin to fight the devils, and the other warehouse workers.  We dispatch of the minions, head to the roof, and see the boss on another roof.  Just as we defeat him, he says “the leader sends his regards”.

Loot:
Lesser reach metamagic wand
Masterwork dagger
Amulate of natural armor +1
Belt of incredible dex +2
Circulet of persuasion
Cloak of resistance +4

Time 4 of:
Potions of invisibility 
Robe of needles
Chain shirt +1
200 masterwork shirikens

We then meet with the leader.  We defeat him in seconds, then search the room and find a suitcase packed.  The gems we find are worth 27,000 gp.  He looks like he was ready to go (or just arrived).

The next day, we receive a runner for the lord mayor who requests our council.  We head to the opera house to meet with him.  Lord Mayor Roxis receives us and introduces us to his other advisors.  He is asking our opinion of what to do with the old temple of Asmodaeous.  Apparently the other religions are arguing over who should take it over.  

We head to a hotel where we will stay with some “honored guests”.  

We then head out and attempt to gather information on the various murders.  We canvas the temple district with diplomacy checks to determine if a drow was seen in the area (connected to Whisker’s murder).  As we get closer to the “clove and hoof society”, some people start recognizing drow (in the red roof district, R6).  They all seem to agree some cultist or mage of some sort (wizard or sorcerer).  Luther said something about a Drow in Vier (location?).  We find out we need to talk to Delacore.
2024-10-13


We head to the post office to receive a letter.  We see Tancis Thrune in the mail room (he is Second cousin once removed from Queen Abigal Thrune).  (a successful bluff on my part) he seems to be in town to deliver us a letter form the queen.  The letter:
“To the rep of the silver ravens.  Greetings once more from the throne of chellax we trust this message reaches you in good health.  We mentioned being in contact soon.  We have cared for kintargo for decades but wish to avoid a war.  We request negotiations between our org and your repos on how to transition kintargo/Revenille out of the domain of chillax.  We request meeting at The Oak Rib Inn in one weeks time.  - Queen”

The Oak Ribb Inn - Large inn, south of the mountains, on our side of the line.  

We send Tancis back to the queen with a response that we will meet them in a week.

We (Max, Gorlon, and Yzma) head with the Goblin to meet Geof Tennesen (G6 of the noble district) while Luthor heads to Lady Delaruge (G7).  The goblin disguises himself as a small noble human.  Liana goes to the park (G5).

As we meet with Geof, which goes… somewhat terribly.  He recommends we go to the Alabaster Academy (head mistress) for magic stuff and to the temple of Shelenlae (head priest) regarding curses.   Gorlon mentions Delarouge, and Geof shutters a bit.  Gorlon asks for access to Geof’s study/library and offers treacherous acts as payment for such access.   Geof offers a letter of recommendation to Gorlon and we leave the manor.  

We eventually meet back up with Liana.  The city guard stops us and suggests that Luther is up to no good.  Lt. Harlow (She) shows up.  She casts a zone of truth upon all of us to ask us questions.  She focuses her questions towards Liana.  

We eventually teleport to the Tooth and Nail tavern and meet up with Luther at our base..  We look through thes safe and determine that the Delarouges are loosing worth as their mines are loosing value.  Luther meditates for a few hours.  

While he’s meditating, we talk with Gorlon about the Alabaster Acadamy, run by a half elf transmuter woman head mistress named Alvana Desteros.  She’s been in charge of the academy for decades.  The academy is known as an academy of higher learning focusing on the magics of the world (a wizards college).  One of the top 3 colleges in all of Chillex, now the top academy of Revinelle.    

Head priest of Shelelae (the goddess of art, a chaotic deity of beauty and art). 

When luther wakes up, he takes the safe and disposes it into the river.  

We head to the academy.  Gorlon signs up for a lecture the following day.  Then we head to the warehouse.



2024-09-15

Today’s agenda: public vote at noon closes at 5p, board of governors meets at noon. 

As we meet at the opera house we get bonuses from music:
Immune for fear
+4 on saves vs charm and compulsion
Immediate action: negate bonuses to get breath of life cast
All weapons within Kintargo are considered silver for the purposes of overcoming DR
All evil outsiders are restrained in movement\

Max casts a spell that gives us +2 bonus against evil outsiders

We brought HIro with us to the opera house.  We poise ourselves in one of the private boxes.
We plan out oredirves and wine for the guests.  Yzma hits both Max and Gorlon with eagle’s spendor wand.   
Raina Solstien arrives and is directed to the upper box.  
Geof Tennesen enters, without escort.  We assign him a servant.  
We are waiting for Lady Delarouge, who is held up at the tea shop.  Max goes to fetch her.  When she arrives, we introduce her with embellished titles.
Carlas Mayheart (we brought from our base)
Strayja Toltella (Olris inhereter) - Tiefling (from our base)

They take roll-call for the board of governors meetings.  Max clarifies why Strayja is there (as an inherited member of the board).  The board calls their votes to order:
Mayheart - Roxis
Toltella - Roxis
Solstien - Valen
Delarouge - Valen
Tennesen - Roxis

As of 3p, Roxis Victicora has been appointed lord mayor of Kintargo.  The nobles leave.  
We meet with a demon about the change in the lord mayor.  

We are waiting for the polls to close.  Gorlon heads to the polls to attempt and rig the vote.  
Roxis won the people’s vote!

New day!

We teleport to City of Acisazi (aquatic elves) to help them with their issue in the Maw.  They take us to their elders.  The Maw is 50 miles due west, in the middle of the water; the entrance is 450 feet below sea level.  Life bubble spell, vests of the deep can help, freedom of movement can help with crushing depths.  They offer us 2 Vests of the Deep (Which we must give back) to aid us.  Max casts Life Bubble on each of us for 7 hours of protection and Air Walk on each of us for 18 min of free movement.  He then teleports us directly to the Maw.  

As we go slowly into the Maw, we discover the monster quickly on the first left cavern…  We defeat them quickly. We eventually encounter a 3-headed sirin that looks like a baby kraken which we defeat quickly.  Then we encounter fish people with sharks, and defeat them, then encounter a devil!  We kill the devil, loot the place, and return to the village.

2024-09-07
Max and Yzma head to the meeting with Jay Jameson (Max had a meeting with them, giving him pictures of spider cat as Jameson is the head of the local paper).  He then fills us in with how the debate will run.  Yzma will be advisor to Roxis (who we now want to win since the ships suddenly left the harbor), and Max will be advisor to Wilk (who we want to loose).  We need to be at the debate by 6, but the debate starts at 7.

We meet a goblin named Gorlon, willing to do anything to get their fire abilities back.  Said something about needing to go to hell or something.  

We spend some time in town purchasing items and then head back to the debate theater to prepare for the debate.  

The debate begins!  Three candidates show up, Roxis, Valen, and Wilk.  Yzma removes herself to use the restroom (plans to fly up and survey the crowd).  Skill checks:
Bluff (26) - Move through crowd pretending to be sick from something I ate.
Perception (26) - to see who in the crowd might be advising Valen (we identify 3 key people)
Sense Motive (19) - See of who in the 3 key people should be the dominate target.  
Knowledge Nobility (15) - Create a winning “we the people” strategy for Roxis
Diplomacy (38) - Deliver a winning speech to Roxis to finish up the debate
Use Magic Device (33) - Attempt to circumvent the magic stones for communications to ruin Valen’s final remarks.

The debate concludes!  Hard to tell which candidate between Roxis and Valen, but the crowd seems to slightly favor Roxis.  

We head back to base and are drawn by a mail call to head to the post office.    Queen Abrigail (of Chiliax, and Thrune family) Thrune  has sent us an urgent letter.  

Paraphrased: “Dear silver ravens, we thank you for your note on how well kintargo is doing.  We have come to the conclusion that the military in kintaro is unwarranted. If this changes in the future, we will send them back.  They will be ready regardless.  We will be in contact soon regarding kintargo.  We cannot guarantee the safety of Kintargo should they find themselves in areas of open conflict.  Official transport of supplies from chillax needs to be focused elsewhere.  We trust you are fine for the immediate future.  Signed the queen.”





2024-07-21
We start in the Hag Hut.  
Hag loot:
Want of cure serious wounds: 20 charge x 3
Want of dispell magic magic: 15 charges x 3
Amulet of natural armor + 2 x 3
Cloak of resistance + 2 x 3
Handy haversac x 3
Headband of vast intelligence + 4 x 3
Spell component pouches x 3
I take
Wands of cure serious
Wands of dispell magic
We teleport back to our base, and talk to Charlotte to teleport us back to the area we need to use the horn.
We take an 8 hours rest to regain spells.  Luther goes out drinking.  
10p
We get Charlotte to teleport us to the edge of the forest to blow some horn (Liana’s thing)
A super demon comes to us through the forest, we dispatch it quickly.  
11p
We blow the horn a second time and wait…
Boar comes, we kill it.
11:30p
Blow horn 3rd time.  Winged creature comes down and asks if we disbanded the hags.  We agree.  Draw up contract and have them sign.  They ask if we can keep all humans and warriors out of the forest.  We agree but dont guarantee.   We then teleport back to the headquarters (just outside).
We rest for the rest of the evening.  

We still need to:
Hold public election
Hold a nobles election

We send out messages to the board of governors to meet at the opera house in 2 (3 days from now is deadline) days time to vote (hopefully Roxis).  The 12 witnesses are us, and all the silver council.  

To host a public election, we need to contact a thrune supporter who managed the public records.  We also need the notary.  We head to castle district to meet with someone about public records.  In the office of public relations, we meet a gnome.  We register to hold public election in 2 days (also).  Results will be released the following day.  Luther inquires about a plot of land to purchase.

We head to the kintargo times paper to have them organize and execute on a public debate for the next day.  On the way there, we encounter a crowd charging some doors with guards holding them back.  The party separates with Yzma heading to the news paper, while Liana and Luther staying with the crowd.

Once at the press, Yzma organizes a debate for the following afternoon at the bridge.  They ask we get Roxis to show up, and see if we can find McTuttles (agree to try but wont).  Then head back to the rest of the party.

Enter a tent of investigators in the center of a crowd.  See a wax effigy torn apart, with dead ratfolk on the ground.  Attempt to draw the runes I see on some parchment.  I become visible and offer to take the body to the ratfolk.  

We take the corpse back to the Guiseppes general store (Back door).  They identify the body as Whiskers.  Also show them the symbol written on my parchment.  
 



2024-06-23
We head to Guiseppe’s to see why they are closed today.  The rat people (giuseppe's people) signal that they are closed through the window. We make our way around back, pick the lock (success) and then knock to show good faith.  Once met at the back door, we introduce ourselves, and meet with them inside their conf room.  They are closed because a family member (Whiskers, brown with black spots along his spine/back) is missing (for 3 days) so they are closed.  We discuss having our people help find whiskers and also discuss our mutual interest in Wilk Wimbleton.  

We go searching for Wilk, on the way, we find some platinum in a barrel.  Eventually we get to a bed&breakfast and meet with a reluctant wilk.  Wilk’s demands: Liana makes a public apology.  We agree and send him to Guiseppe’s to seek funding while Liana makes a public statement that I (Yzma) designs (a non-denial denial type of speech).  

We ask Roxis to campaign poorly and then pull his candidacy last sec and pledge his followers to Wilk.   We also set out some ‘secret squirrels’ (hiring the cryers) to help push support for wilk.  

City of Acisazi (aquatic elves) is a 4 day journey from us on foot.  We also need to deal with the storm hags.  We head to the aquatic elves.  We buy scrolls of water breathing, then have Charlotte (betrothed to my cousin) to teleport us (Luther, Liana, Flynn, Yzma) to City of Acisazi (a-za-zee).  She teleports us to the center of the city.  

They tell us they receive threats carved into corpses from the father of chilex (the same one the group found in the yubollis river).  A fearsome creature has moved into the Maw (Charybdis).  We vow to come back and help them with their Charybdis situation in less than a week in exchange for their support.  We present them with the contract, they sign, we depart and head to Revenelle (to deal with the hags) via teleport.  Then we head into the forest!

We encounter a Rust devil hiding (poorly) in the forest, who turns Liana into metal.  Yzma reverses the spell using the orb of chaos while Luther kills the demon.

Eventually we approach some hut on stilts with some humanoid body parts scattered around the base near a cauldron.  We cast some preparing spells as a hag approaches from around a tree.  It was a tough fight, but we eventually beat the hags.  We also turn Liana back to human form.  We need to follow up with whatever contract needs to be created as a result of this (I dont know)
Treasure from the hags:
Efficient quiver (decorated with decapatations of stricts skulls)
Gem of brightness (9 charges)
Phylactery of positive channeling
Ring of major electricity resistance
24 gems (4500 gp)
Jewled golden necklace (holy symbol of Calistria elven goddess of revenge) (3000gp)
840 platinum pieces
3400 gold pieces
3 unholy symbols of Rovagug (god of destruction and chaos)
I take
Gem of Brightness
Ring of major electricity resistance
5100 gp

  




2024-05-05
Silver council meeting in the morning as we meet up with Luther and Liana.   We purchase a lesser restoration to heal hero’s strength damage.  We also trade the barrels of acid:
Ring of mechanical devices - Given to Liana
Headband of intuition - Take
Potion of magic vestment - Take
Scroll of greater invisibility - Take
Scroll of dispel evil - Take
50 charges wand of eagle splendor - Take

Notes: we need to convince the ships in the harbor to not bombard the city (convince them we are trying to get the rebellion under control).

Head to “Cloven hoof society” to handle a rumor of murderers.  Encountering 2 guards, we bluff our way through and meet with Luthor in the kitchen to see a gruesome murder scene.  We meet with Luthor, he expresses how gruesome the scene is (someone is cut up and setup as a roast).  Gatris Pinderock (tiefling, worked at the society, most popular chefs) was the victim.  Found by fellow tiefling when they were opening the society this morning.  Man was known for sense of humor with positive attitude.  Murder took place some time last night.  Back of neck has a puncture mark, with a small chemical burn.  In the room, notice there are a set of kitchen knives missing.  Find slender boot print in the blood, near a wall that has no door (facing the wall).  Detecting slight, fading, transmutation, aura on the wall.  Something about melding with the wall.  Possible link to “Nerdeburger” (iknown for skinsaw murders).  We reach the max our skills can tell us about the scene.  

We decide to head to the harbor to meet with the captain of the boats.  We meet 2 dinghies at the harbor and they take us out to the boats. Captain of the Blue Lightning, (black death is the other ship, and vice admiril of the hell fire, the dreadnaught).  We gt to the blue lightning, and board the ship (I play off the upper class helpless damsel role).  We meet with first mate Donegel, who explains we will be meeting with the vice admiral.   We do see the captain monitoring the situation from the bridge deck.  We are lead to the captains quarters where the vice admiral waits for us.  Vice Admiral Sargatta (originally a captain that luther encountered earlier), recognizes Luther.  

The admiral expresses that the queen wants the place “back to order” (we read that as destroyed).  If the election doesnt go to plan (seeing their Valen Sirini elected), they may start bombing the city.  We express a favor of 3 weeks to establish wilk wimbledon as lord mayor (bluffing successfully) as a compromise to ensure a victory for the Queen.  The vice admiral agrees, and we are on our way back to shore.

We still need the witches and the revenel forest areas to give us support so their areas aren’t destroyed once we get the council together to elect Roxis, but still convince the people that Roxis is the best choice so they get the illusion of power.    

Potential plan to pose to Validar and Max: We have 3 weeks to instate Wilk as lord Mayor (with Roxis coming in second for support).   We could get the people to like him (return to glory/underdog story, plus he is corruptible moreso than Valen).  We get the council to vote in Roxis.  Do that in 2 weeks.  For the 3rd week, we make it look like Wilk’s laws are going into effect while Roxis writes the queen enacting the loophole in the contract, banishing Thrune from Kintargo (and outlying territories).  Then we have something happen to Wilk, with Roxis taking over after that week.  

We decide to teleport to Cypress point to get the signoff from the mayor regarding the Ziggernaught.  We meet with the mayor.  (turns out he’s a priest of Arestal  but we dont know it but he has holy symbols in a drawer).  We bluff him into thinking that the Ziggeraut is taken care of in exchange for his allegiance.  We write up a quick contract expressing such.  He duplicates the contract and gives us the original.  

2024-04-28
Recap: Nobles close the gates to the nobles districts.  Dreadnought and 2 battle ships shown up in the harbor off the coast within striking distance.  Day 6 (today), Roxis is holding a “get to know me” public forum.  Wilk Wimbleton has been removed from candidacy due to disgrace.  Elibin (capt of guard to replace luthor) has removed his candidacy and is now to be appointed as under Luthor.  McTuttles (palidin) assigned to the city to loosen the grasp of thrune rule.  We are trying to get the leaders of the regions to align themselves with our candidate.  

Session:
We appear north of the Ziggurat, just outside the “shadow aura” (darkness pulling in all light).  Nothing seems to be growing (lack of sunlight prevents things from growing, for the most part, but things arent just not growing, the things that did grow are dead, so thats odd).    We have “Hero” with us (recruited sword fighter).

We approach the western side of the Ziggurat.    We head up the main stairs (40’) up to the top.  Detecting magic shows an illusionary aurora in the center of the top platform.  We determine the aurora is a hole in the floor, so we attempt to move down (fly/floating).  We eventually see a floor at the bottom.  We continue all the way down to the floor inside the hole.  We notice skulls impaled on spikes (Zull Kathull, ancient religious concept, the tar oozing around, shadow tar, from another plane).  The alter begins shifting ,then blasting waves, blasting our shadows away form us, with them forming into enemies of us.  

Eventually a huge bat (shadow night shade/night wing) shows up on the northern staircase.  We take out the bat and destroy the trap in the center, and head up the stairs to the north.  

We head further down the dungeon and discover 2 large creatures kneeling behind an overturned table attacking us with rocks (shadow giants).  Volidar possesses one, while we put the other unconscious.  We find an alter, Voldimar commands the monster to destroy the alter.  We find a chest in the bedroom:
+ 2 champion breast plate
Beaststrike Club
Ring of the sea strider
Lesser maximized meta magic rod
Pair of shoes of lightning leaping
Glove of storing (contains an item: Orb of utter chaos)
Silver necklace - Holy simple of Desna (500gp)
Single Aqua Marine (320gp)
Velvet Pouch with 10 (1200 gp)
750 Platinum
2000 gp

We walk to a nearby farmer, and offer to “rent” (without intention of return) 4 barrels and head back to the Ziggurat.  We load 4 barrels of shadow liquid, kill the 2 giants, and setup camp outside the Ziggurat.  

Volidar determines there is a large dragon in the Ziggurat, which invites us to chat. So we go back to the Ziggurat.  We determine that he will continue to take residence back in the ziggurat.  We sleep for the night.  We teleport back to Kintargo with the 4 barrels of shadow liquid in an attempt to sell them.





2024-03-03
We start off in the Yolubillis district (Y4).  We send some note to the queen of delights (in Vier), asking they help us “or else”, and another to the Mayor of Acise.  

The next day:  We head to Cypress point (town north of kintargo).  Head to the city hall to meet with the mayor Xyerilia (mayor of Cypress).  We gently “urge” the mayor to support the lord mayor vote for Kintargo.  We start off terribly with bribery and threats, finally trying a more diplomatic approach.  We take the mayor to lunch, and attempt to get their support for our mayoral candidate.  She asks us to prove our good faith to Cypress by going to the Zigerat of Night (where an Umbral Dragon known as “Intheor” lives, but forced to abandon the Zigerat, which is now under Needahl (country) control) and riding it of it’s inhabitants.    (6 days overland travel south by southeast to the Zigerat of Night).  We head back to Kintargo (Temple of T3).

As we walk around the street, a group of sailors from the local ships approaches us.  Wanting to take us to the Guardhouse (C5).  On the way to the gardens, we notice a protest going on that we attempt to break up.  I dominate 1 person asking them to help dissipate the crowd, attempt to dominate another (failing), then finally turning into a dragon positioning myself behind luther as he blows fire into the sky.  The crowd backs away once they see the dragon. 

We head to the Ziggurat of Night.  



2023-12-03
We got an in at the Amethyst Dragon for the night.  Luther went out on his own.
In the morning we head back to headquarters.
We craft a letter to the queen of delights.  
We meet with Sally (wasnt listening on who this is, but we were summoned there to meet).  She’s a vampire and apparently the Silver ravens killed her master (freeing her).  We learn about their enemies (conflicting vampire nests) in the village districts.  We decide to go hunting for vampire nests.  We encounter some incorporeal enemies and go into battle with them.  We take them out without issue.  
2023-11-05

We wake to hearing noise on the street above our compound.  Drax, from the warcage (some large fully armored person) greets Max (Matt) at the door.  He’s here to participate in the silver raven council meeting.  Topics discussed:

Jonathan McTuttles is the people’s choice for candidacy for lord mayor.  
Merchants are backing Wilk Wimbleton for lord mayor
Nobles are backing Velen Sereney
Charlote’s oldest remaining brother
Family was known to be Throne supporters
Roxis Victicora is favored by us (the silver ravens) - He died and we reincarnated him at some point

Deleruge (Madam), Mayhart, Tennyson, Toltella (Strayja),  Solestein (Raina) are the 5 noble families that make up the board (of governors) that has to vote for mayor.

Meeting concludes and we head out.  Head to the theater in R1.  Workmen are building sets in the theater.  We strike up a conversation with the workers but instead start attracting a crowd.  We determine where the foreman/Stage-Manager for the crew is working (in a small covered wagon nearby).   The play’s name is “The fall of the rockhouse” in 2 weeks.  The Solstien’s will have their troop perform in 2 weeks.  We make our way into the stage managers trailer and meet an elf, who doesnt recognize us.  The elf, Zander Solstien, introduces himself.  We say we are looking for Raina Solstien (cousin of Zelex), he says she’ll be in the mansion and we will go see her.  

We meet with Madam Raina.  We discuss arts, then into political conversations.  She seems to be heavily into the Arts.  We explain our desire to free the city from the greater Chilliax and that the board of governors, for as outdated as it is, is needed to be formal.  She mentions we are responsible for a lot of death in the city, which she is sad about.  She agrees to help us with the board of governors but vows she will not back Wilk WImbleton.  

We head to the Girls school to meet with Lady DelLacore.  She believes she would make a good lord mayor but she obviously not work well as she runs a thieves guild (the only one in the city).  She believe the next best choice would be Roxis Victicora.  Outside of that, she believes she’s the best candidate.   We wait at the coffee shop while we send a raven to the Tennessan requesting his audience. His response acknowledges our request.

We head to the estate of Geoff Tennessan (G6, my old house) via dimension door.  We meet with him after a long wait (3 hour power play from him).  He refuses to give us who he is backing until we publicly (the silver ravens) support a candidate.    We determine that Roxis is our candidate and Geoff seems to be interested in that (he seems to be a supporter of kintargo rather than of thrune).  After some back and forth we think we have his favor if we can promote Roxis as a candidate within our channels.  When we left, Geoff had a note passed to me that ultimately said he regretted the wedge in the family and wished he had been more involved in my upbringing.  

We head to the theatre, alter the production message for the play to promote Roxis.  Then head back to our guild but get side tracked by a crowd centered around a halfling (Wilk Wimbleton).  Luther withdraws, Liana rushes the stage, pants Wilk, and pushes him into the crowd while she promotes Roxis.    

We head back to talk to Roxis informing him that we need him to run for lord mayor.   On our way to meeting Luthor, and (Estiear Abon), at a bar (Amethyst Dragon) we run into Johnathan McTuttles (a paladin healing a peasant in an alleyway).  We introduce ourselves and mention our candidate Roxis (McTutles claims to loathe politics) and ask he continue to support the people of Kintargo.  

We continue to the Amethyst Dragon.  We talk with Estaban and determine he might be an agent of the Glorious Reclamation.  He explains to us why he would be a good candidate for captain.  He asks us to support him as lieutenant instead of captain if we don’t like him as captain.    We end the session near curfew at the Amethyst Dragon.






  



2023-10-01

Been bunking with other unnamed rebels in the silver ravens HQ (very lack luster)
In O7 district
Repurposed (thieves) guild hall
It’s under ground, above ground is a burned down tavern.
Some magical sub-basement that no one has maintained
Pumps running that pump out water otherwise the subbasement would flood



Matt Scryes some target (Taltella, tiefling), we send a raven to find it and we follow the raven. We follow the raven to the Y2-Y4 district docks.  We break into the warehouse building where we think this target is being held (in a cage) and discover lots of cages with people locked in them.  We battle some slavers for a bit, a barbed devil pops in, reclaims some papers/ledgers upstairs, then teleports away.  Max(Matt) saves the person we are there to save and teleports away.  We loot the place. Find a partial ledger of prior transactions throughout the country and transportation time tables.  This was a slave trade establishment. 

We later, head to a formal dinner party (dressed to impress) at the Deleruge estate.  Yzema sits at the opposing head of the table.  I use my intimidation and bluff on another noble who attempts to power play me in conversation.  We eventually meet the barroness and have verbal fencing with her.  We eventually get the room alone with her.  We ask her for help in her voting power (we part of the vote of governors).  We determine we will have to send her gold (and gear, hunting stuff and magic stuff especially) to get her to vote in ways we want (support her family financially).  We will arrange that meeting at a later date.  We head back to headquarters and go to bed.

We still need to gain favor of Tennisen.  Need representatives from gardens district and temple.

Attended the celebration to honor the silver ravens at the breakbridge.  It’s interrupted by Rufus (some bad guy) who has demons with him calling the ravens murders and thieves.  Battle ensues with Rufus (my cousin) flying away along with Luthor grappling him as he flies.  I fly along side attempting to dominate multiple times, with him succeeding his saves every time.  Rufus flies over the water, I dispel his fly ability and he falls into the water with Luthor still grappling him.  Finally dominate takes hold and I command Rufus to cooperate with Rufu’s notions.  Once they surface, I tie up rufus’s hands, and take his Cloak of Resistance + 2.


Child of Kintigaro Trait:
You had the fortune (or perhaps the misfortune, depending on your viewpoint) to be born
into one of Kintargo’s noble families. Your experience growing up among the city’s well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the new situation in Kintargo brewing, there is much
concern about an eventual restructuring of the city’s nobility. Already, one noble estate has burned to the ground under what can best be described as suspicious circumstances, but whether the government or rebels were responsible depends on whom you ask. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in the Greens. If you want to be a member of one of Kintargo’s major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar on page 11) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a noble’s outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. If you take the Noble Scion feat, your last name is probably Aulamaxa, Aulorian, Delronge, Jarvis, Jhaltero, Sarini, Tanessen, or Vashnarstill; if you’re not human, you were adopted into the family. If you don’t take this feat, you can
make up your last name.  Geoff Tennessan (spell check), your father is a powerful mage and practiced swordsman. Unlike your older brothers and cousin he’s not a’blind’ fanatic of thrune. He knows what’s important and probably taught you several lessons in spell casting. It was probably your natural affinity to magic rather than study that caused your siblings to bully and outcast you.

Chillax invasion is imminent.  The town isn’t abiding by local laws now that Thrune is no more.  If we don’t call the town to order in some way, Chillax will invade and take order back in Kintargo.

We go into the plane of Hell.
I cast Shield, Mage Armor, 

We meet a demon receptionist for Adoxidie, the contract devil.  Dispatch both receptionists.  We go into a main room with demon on a rug.  Take a magic spoon from a room, and an ornate bowl.  I couldnt identify the spoon (rolled 7).  Next we went into a room where someone was being tortured by 2 demons however I wasn’t paying attention (1 on perception).  I dimension door’ed over to the person once I noticed them.  They wiggle out of their bindings but I can’t make heads or tails of them so I cast Spell Resistance on myself and attempt to communicate with them.  Taval of Armrest is his name. He hid a scroll (Attempted to slight of hand it on us).  He is some sort of rogue.  Llana is confrontational towards him.   Marius reads his thoughts and determines he’s a chaotic neutral.  

We go into another room where a demon librarian casts black tenticals on all of us.  Matt Teleports us out of them and we then head to meet with the head demon who helps us understand the Kintargo contract:

Grants house thrune support of hell in policing its empire.  All regions of Revenell are supported witht he arch duchy of <something>.  If no lord mayor exists then house Thrune can enter a region at will.  The hidden clause is hidden: 

Families allowed to vote on the board of Kintigargo:
Deleruge
Mayhart
Solston
Urvis
Tenneson


Notes to self: 
Rob the rogue (if Good alignment allows for that)
Buy another dispel scroll
 


General Notes

2 captains of the guards over Kintargo
